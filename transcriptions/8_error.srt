1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:05,839
I wasn't to the point

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,820
to admit it yet.

3
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:10,210
But the really chilling words

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,849
about Roger, that was still

5
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:13,250
to come.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,589
He said, I have killed

7
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:16,649
for you.

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,699
I have hurt a lot

9
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:20,480
of people.

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,929
But I killed for you,

11
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:26,699
and I think that's mine.

12
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:30,050
Meanwhile, Roger is released from

13
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,589
the hospital after his insulin

14
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:32,009
overdose

15
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,729
and is brought directly into

16
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:34,729
police custody.

17
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:39,590
Where Detective Golicky greets him

18
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,969
again after eight long years.

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,439
Roger, what are you doing?

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,320
What's going on?

21
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,000
Remember me?

22
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:50,820
Scott Golicky.

23
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,020
So after all that, you

24
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,640
sit down with Roger years

25
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,399
later from the last interrogation.

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:58,799
Yes.

27
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,740
Is he a different man?

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,299
Yes, we both aged a

29
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,500
lot, probably me more than

30
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:02,719
him.

31
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,239
After the domestic, he was

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:04,799
clearly suicidal.

33
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,349
And so when I see

34
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:08,269
him, it's not his best

35
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:08,469
day.

36
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,069
It's not his best day.
