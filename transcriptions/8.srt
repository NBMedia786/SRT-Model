1
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:06,500
Newly installed prosecutor Jennifer Mudge

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,160
is working hard with police

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,099
to try to solve

4
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:11,480
Bonnie Woodward's cold case. They

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,660
believe they can break it

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,980
if a Carroll family member

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,339
talks.

8
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:16,949
As detectives are talking to

9
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,670
Roger Carroll's wife, Monica, they

10
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,109
get intriguing new info.

11
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,149
She remembers her husband taking

12
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:24,030
a peculiar interest in Bonnie

13
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,250
Woodward's daily life

14
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,359
before she disappeared. Monica talked

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,280
about conversations that she thought

16
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,679
was odd about

17
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,240
where specifically Bonnie worked, what

18
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,479
type of work schedule she

19
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,539
had. I don't remember what

20
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:42,600
shift she worked or you

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,520
know the days but I

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,899
remember those were in conversation.

23
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,079
I just

24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,259
remember thinking that it was

25
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,479
very odd that he's asking

26
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,780
all these details. She now

27
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,399
is starting to

28
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,420
put everything together and is

29
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,439
fearing for her own life

30
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,299
at the same time. Looking

31
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:58,140
back on it now

32
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,439
I've been scared for a

33
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,539
long time but I just

34
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,739
I wasn't

35
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:06,299
you know I didn't know

36
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:06,659
what to do. I didn't

37
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:06,659
know what to do. I

38
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:06,719
didn't know what to do.

39
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:08,629
I didn't

40
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:09,230
know what to do. I

41
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:09,409
didn't know what to do.

42
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:09,829
I didn't know what to

43
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:09,829
do. I didn't know what

44
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:10,370
to do. I didn't

45
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,010
know what to do. I

46
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:12,950
didn't know what to do.

47
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:13,750
I didn't know what to

48
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,290
do. I didn't know what

49
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,890
to do. I didn't

50
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,150
know what to do. I

51
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,000
didn't know what to do.

52
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,459
I didn't know what to

53
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:20,040
do. I didn't know what

54
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,040
to do. I didn't

55
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,040
know what to do. I

56
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,040
didn't know what to do.

57
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,040
I didn't know what to

58
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,040
do. I didn't know what

59
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,890
to do. I didn't

60
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,260
know what to do. I

61
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,819
didn't know what to do.

62
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,120
I didn't know what to

63
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,079
do. I didn't know what

64
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:41,140
to do. I didn't

65
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:49,969
know what to do. I

66
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:53,379
didn't know what to do.

67
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:53,599
I didn't know what to

68
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:53,599
do. I didn't know what

69
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:53,760
to do. I didn't know

70
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,980
what to do. I didn't

71
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,099
know what to do. I

72
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,099
didn't know what to do.

73
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,359
I didn't know what to

74
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,879
do. I didn't know what

75
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:58,879
to do. I didn't know

76
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:58,900
what to do. I didn't

77
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:58,920
know what to do. I

78
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:58,920
didn't know what to do.

79
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:58,939
I didn't know what to

80
00:01:58,939 --> 00:01:58,939
do. I didn't know what

81
00:01:58,939 --> 00:01:58,939
to do. I didn't know

82
00:01:58,939 --> 00:01:58,939
what to do. I didn't

83
00:01:58,939 --> 00:01:58,939
know what to do. I

84
00:01:58,939 --> 00:01:58,939
didn't know what to do.

85
00:01:58,939 --> 00:01:58,939
I didn't know what to

86
00:01:58,939 --> 00:01:58,939
do. I didn't know what

87
00:01:58,939 --> 00:01:58,939
to do. I didn't know

88
00:01:58,939 --> 00:01:58,939
what to do. I didn't

89
00:01:58,939 --> 00:01:59,079
know what to do. I

90
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,819
didn't know what to do.

91
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:00,739
I didn't know what to

92
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:02,500
do. I didn't know what

93
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,900
to do. I didn't know

94
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,379
what to do. I didn't

95
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:06,439
know what to do. I

96
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,199
didn't know what to do.

97
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,340
I didn't know what to

98
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,780
do.

99
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,280
You know, I had to

100
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,000
say a word, but if

101
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,520
you want to hear me

102
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,520
out, I think it might

103
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,439
be worth your while, but

104
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,500
it's your prerogative. You're driving

105
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:19,840
this bus.

106
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:20,919
I had started it with,

107
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:21,639
hey, Roger, you don't have

108
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,319
to say anything if you

109
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,580
don't want, but we've opened

110
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,960
this case. This train's coming

111
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,460
down the road.

112
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,479
I think what's going to

113
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,819
happen now is that this

114
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:29,639
is a homicide investigation, and

115
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,900
it's moving in that direction.

116
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,400
I was basically telling him,

117
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,500
charges on this case are

118
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,000
now imminent.

119
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,500
But some of the intimate

120
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
details and the specific details,

121
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,900
only you know.

122
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:41,479
It's the right thing to

123
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,520
do for Bonnie yourself, also

124
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,340
the right thing for you.

125
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,719
There's no way you're enjoying

126
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,379
living with this.

127
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,439
But if Detective Golicki is

128
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,659
counting on a crisis of

129
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:54,060
conscience from Roger Carroll, he's

130
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,960
about to be disappointed.

131
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,800
We've opened this case. This

132
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,740
train's coming down the road.

133
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,500
Like, I'm giving you an

134
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,280
opportunity to try to mitigate

135
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,939
the circumstances.

136
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,319
Are you comfortable with the

137
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,020
whole situation?

138
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:10,860
Well, no. I mean, I'm

139
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,780
not going to talk to

140
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,280
you. You know, call my

141
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,360
attorney, please.

142
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,860
Like, I interviewed him for

143
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,020
an hour and some change,

144
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:19,819
and really for 55 minutes,

145
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,639
he just didn't speak.

146
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,710
Since Roger completely clams up,

147
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,189
they bring his wife Monica

148
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:26,750
in again. And turns out,

149
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,889
she does have more to

150
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:28,110
share.

151
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,590
So you had a feeling

152
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,969
that something...

153
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:32,030
Something went right?

154
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,509
Something happened.

155
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:36,210
Otherwise, you, I think...

156
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:37,189
You would have questioned it.

157
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,469
Your internal feelings.

158
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,030
Said that something went right.

159
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:40,349
Yeah.

160
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:41,870
That things weren't right.

161
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:43,849
When he said that he's

162
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,490
killed people for me, to

163
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,759
protect me and Nathan, I

164
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:53,129
know that's not right.

165
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:54,889
I know it's not right

166
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:57,610
that he should kill someone,

167
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,659
feel that he has a

168
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:01,060
right to kill someone to

169
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,740
protect me.

170
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,560
And you're not aware of

171
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,280
anything else in your history

172
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,620
with Roger or...

173
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:12,300
You know, with Nathan, that

174
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,379
he would be talking about

175
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,889
other than Bonnie Woodward.

176
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,370
Right.

177
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,449
The only person that come

178
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:20,649
to my mind would be

179
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:21,089
Bonnie.

180
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,490
Monica says Roger issues her

181
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,410
a stark warning about Bonnie's

182
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:25,689
family.

183
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,189
He made it sound like

184
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:30,579
it'd be my fault if

185
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:32,100
something happened to our family,

186
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:35,240
if I ever told him.

187
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,139
So I didn't want to

188
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:44,410
be the one to be

189
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,610
the cause of our family

190
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,689
being torn apart.

191
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,220
I didn't want to hear

192
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:50,459
it.

193
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,019
Because I recall I told

194
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:55,879
him I didn't want to

195
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:56,220
hear it.

196
00:04:57,569 --> 00:04:59,029
We knew that Monica was

197
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:00,829
not there at that time.

198
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,230
And we were also pretty

199
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,610
confident that she didn't show

200
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,829
up until a day later.

201
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:08,529
That's when Monica describes approaching

202
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:10,089
their son Nathan with her

203
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:10,709
suspicions.

204
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,379
I told Nathan that Roger

205
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,980
told me, I have killed

206
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,449
for you.

207
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:21,529
And he was like, don't

208
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,610
ever repeat that, Mom.

209
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:24,759
Don't ever repeat.

210
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:27,519
But what might it take

211
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,199
for Nathan to start talking?
