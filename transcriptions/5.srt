1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,399
And investigators say they aren't

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:04,599
taking no for an answer

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:05,000
either.

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,980
Bonnie's now 18 -year -old

5
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,439
stepdaughter, Heather Woodward, who also

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:11,580
strangely went missing a week

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,400
before Bonnie, has now suddenly

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,140
reappeared.

9
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,850
Okay, Heather, we just need

10
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,629
to ask you a few

11
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:18,289
things here.

12
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,070
After hours of questioning from

13
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,210
detectives, Heather seems finally ready

14
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,829
to reveal the identity of

15
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:25,350
the people she says helped

16
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:25,870
her run away.

17
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:28,179
They're not going to get

18
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:29,359
in trouble, are they?

19
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,460
I don't know about that,

20
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:31,219
but I want to at

21
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:32,659
least know what, what, where

22
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:33,159
you've been.

23
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:36,289
I want to make sure

24
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:36,789
that you're safe.

25
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,149
Do they have any kids

26
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:41,590
your age?

27
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,750
Okay.

28
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,479
So is Nathan Carroll's family?

29
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,789
Okay.

30
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:55,060
The police department had learned

31
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,299
that she had been at

32
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:56,979
the Carroll house.

33
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,840
Heather had told Roger Carroll

34
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,579
and Monica Carroll that she

35
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:02,500
had run away from home

36
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,379
because Bonnie was mean to

37
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,700
her, and that she had

38
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,420
gone to the Carroll house

39
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,219
to hide from Bonnie until

40
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:09,879
she turned 18.

41
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,859
Both Monica and Roger were

42
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:14,620
in the medical field, and

43
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,840
their son Nathan was a

44
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,299
typical 16 -year -old high

45
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:18,420
school student.

46
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,620
There was no criminal history

47
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,060
on record for them, no

48
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,019
police involvement, no arrests or

49
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:24,500
anything like that.

50
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,920
The Carrolls go to the

51
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,939
same church in Wood River,

52
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,280
so the Carrolls get to

53
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,700
know Heather, I think, on

54
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,819
church -related activities.

55
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,799
And one of those church

56
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,920
activities they went to?

57
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,959
A graduation party for Heather

58
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,519
and other seniors, just two

59
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,159
weeks before Bonnie went missing.

60
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,159
We obviously had to explore

61
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,299
the avenue of, are they

62
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:45,159
involved with Bonnie?

63
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,459
I think the police were

64
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:47,900
like, well, they had, you

65
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,379
know, Heather at the house,

66
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:50,459
then what else do they

67
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:50,640
know?

68
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,739
We went to their listed

69
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:57,700
address in the Jersey County

70
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,120
area.

71
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:01,000
They're living in among 60

72
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,079
acres of property.

73
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,620
It's just a lot of

74
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,900
wooded, open land.

75
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:08,229
What jumps out at you

76
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,289
about Roger Carroll?

77
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,569
He's in his 40s with

78
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:13,810
the brownish -gray hair, 5

79
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,770
'10 -ish.

80
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:16,389
His primary car is a

81
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:19,610
silver 2005 Chevrolet Malibu, which

82
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,449
is the suspect vehicle description.

83
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,000
We towed the vehicle to

84
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,039
our police department and ultimately

85
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,560
processed this vehicle for any

86
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,960
evidence related to our case.

87
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,979
This investigation is now shifting

88
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:32,819
into high gear.

89
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,080
Monica and Roger Carroll come

90
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,879
in for questioning.

91
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,780
You are Roger William Carroll,

92
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:38,500
Jr.

93
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,180
I don't want to answer

94
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,439
any more questions until we

95
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,259
speak with our attorney.

96
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,599
Okay.

97
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:46,300
You decided to be evoked

98
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,180
right to counsel, correct?

99
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:47,960
Yes, ma 'am.

100
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,539
Heather Woodward, Bonnie's stepdaughter, is

101
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,900
also called in again the

102
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,740
very same day

103
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,620
and pressed for more information

104
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,840
about the day Bonnie went

105
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,219
missing.

106
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,219
What do you know about

107
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,280
Bonnie leaving and what happened

108
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,800
whenever she left or was...

109
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,340
I mean, I know...

110
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,020
I know that she got

111
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,639
in the car with some

112
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,240
guy and they drove off,

113
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,879
that's all I know.

114
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,039
Did they talk about the

115
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,240
car?

116
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,819
Yeah, it was a silver

117
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:11,560
and gray car, Malibu.

118
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:12,360
Okay.

119
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,139
That's it. That's all I

120
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:13,340
know.

121
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,419
Does that sound like any

122
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:16,500
car that you're familiar with?

123
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,120
No.

124
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,900
Oh, besides Roger's car.

125
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,580
Okay.

126
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:21,460
Look, Roger wanted her to

127
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:21,740
fly.

128
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:25,900
Investigators then confront Heather with

129
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,039
a new piece of information.

130
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,740
They found out that she

131
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,199
and the Carrolls were together

132
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,520
at a lake house in

133
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,759
the days just before Bonnie

134
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,280
went missing.

135
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:33,759
Okay.

136
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,919
They went down to Monica's

137
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,580
parents in Goreville, Illinois on

138
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,759
a small trip, just the

139
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,460
four of them.

140
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,060
And detectives grow even more

141
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,060
suspicious when Heather shares that

142
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,439
Roger and his son Nathan

143
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,719
returned home by themselves on

144
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,159
the same day Bonnie disappeared.

145
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,120
Roger and Nathan came home

146
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,560
on Friday.

147
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:52,919
We came home on Saturday,

148
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,599
me and Monica.

149
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,860
Why did they leave on

150
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,159
Friday?

151
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,520
Monica told me that he

152
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,580
just wanted to get home

153
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,919
and he made Nathan go

154
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,259
with him.

155
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,039
He brought Nathan with him,

156
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,199
got up and left at

157
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,939
7 o 'clock in the

158
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:04,080
morning on June 5th.

159
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:06,000
On June 25th, Friday morning,

160
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,240
the day Bonnie disappeared.

161
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,259
Now, the question I have

162
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:12,699
here is, the guy that

163
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,740
meets with Bonnie up at

164
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,220
the nursing home, he's in

165
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,220
a gray Malibu, silver gray

166
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,779
Malibu.

167
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,019
How do I know that

168
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:20,920
Roger's not the one that

169
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,879
met with Bonnie up there

170
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:22,939
that Friday?

171
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,060
I don't know.

172
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,620
Roger, Bonnie's never met Roger,

173
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,160
so I don't know why

174
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,019
she came to the car

175
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:30,379
with him.

176
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:32,569
What if he told her,

177
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,189
hey, I know where Heather

178
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:34,569
is.

179
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,449
Why don't you come with

180
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:35,629
me?

181
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,790
And.

182
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,199
You need to pick her

183
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:37,439
up.

184
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:39,060
I don't.

185
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,019
Do you think Bonnie would

186
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:40,540
have gotten in a car

187
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:40,959
with him then?

188
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,740
No, she doesn't care about

189
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:42,939
me.

190
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,779
So you have a lot

191
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:46,759
of circumstantial evidence, but nothing

192
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,000
that cracks the case open.

193
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:49,899
It is all circumstantial.

194
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,060
There wasn't enough to link

195
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,060
Roger Carroll or Monica Carroll

196
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,339
to Bonnie's disappearance.

197
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,120
However, both of them at

198
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,379
that time were charged with

199
00:04:58,379 --> 00:04:59,319
harboring a runaway.

200
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,180
Both Roger and Monica plead

201
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,500
not guilty to this charge,

202
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,180
but this turns out to

203
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,300
be a helpful tool for

204
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:05,779
investigators.

205
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,339
In getting those charges.

206
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,800
We can also get fingerprints.

207
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,959
We can get photographs.

208
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,860
And then you put Roger

209
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,459
in a lineup.

210
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:14,420
We did.

211
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,319
We used this mugshot primarily

212
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,699
with the employees at Unismith.

213
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,939
And that did not come

214
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:21,540
up with a match.

215
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:22,279
It did not.

216
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:23,699
That resulted in no positive

217
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:24,060
IDs.

218
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,800
The family members must be

219
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,519
chomping at the bit at

220
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:27,980
this point.

221
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:28,459
They are.

222
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,779
But sometimes the cases move

223
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:31,899
when they want to move.

224
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,860
Did you feel like there

225
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,860
had to have been somebody

226
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,199
out there that knew more

227
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:38,860
than they were saying?

228
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:39,300
I think.

229
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,019
I think that somebody that

230
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:41,819
is just trying to locate

231
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:42,899
a loved one often feels

232
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:45,199
like somebody's not talking or

233
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:46,149
somebody's lying.

234
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,459
Summer winds to a close

235
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:51,560
without Bonnie Woodward and without

236
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,819
answers until news of a

237
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:55,399
body found on the banks

238
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,639
of the Mississippi River here

239
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,420
in Alton, Illinois, leaves her

240
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,040
loved ones holding their breath.

241
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,300
Every time a body comes

242
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,660
up, we call 51 days

243
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,040
exactly.

244
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,720
She's been gone and we

245
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,000
have not one solid answer.

246
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,740
That body, it turns out,

247
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,939
is not Bonnie Woodward.

248
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,459
But.

249
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:10,279
But a break in the

250
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,139
case is coming.

251
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,500
The lab results from Bonnie's

252
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,879
abandoned truck are back.

253
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,939
And the results are stunning.

254
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:19,180
The crime lab comes back

255
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,720
with a very significant hit.

256
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,439
Yes.

257
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:24,879
You understand what we're trying

258
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,839
to tell you right now?

259
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,220
There's new physical evidence in

260
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:27,699
this case.

261
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,180
I said we have to

262
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,720
jump now.

263
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:30,819
This is our time.

264
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,079
I'm thinking I'm going to

265
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:32,300
die.

266
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,120
It's crazy.

267
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,500
Absolutely crazy.
