1
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:02,649
Matt, what time did you

2
00:00:02,649 --> 00:00:03,129
get here today?

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,620
9 .30 -ish.

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:06,240
All right.

5
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:08,310
So, me and Emily are

6
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,050
just hanging out.

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,720
I'm shaking.

8
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,150
Vito comes in, and he's

9
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,910
got the gun that I've

10
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,230
got set out on the

11
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:17,510
counter.

12
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:19,089
I just had it sitting

13
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:19,370
there.

14
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,690
What did you have it

15
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,210
sitting there for?

16
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:22,890
I was going to talk

17
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,269
to Emily about the importance

18
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,710
of, hey, you know, for

19
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,530
one, this dude really liked

20
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:28,789
you.

21
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:30,429
For two, he talked about

22
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:31,129
creepy stuff.

23
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:32,929
And for three, he came

24
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:34,030
to the house.

25
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,179
Was it your gun or

26
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:36,920
your father's gun?

27
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:37,880
It's my dad's gun.

28
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,460
All right.

29
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:44,909
And he walks around the

30
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:47,009
corner, and he says, you

31
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:47,789
know, that if I do

32
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:48,810
anything, he's going to shoot

33
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:49,090
Emily.

34
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,280
And then he goes in,

35
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,899
you know, he tapes this

36
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:55,159
up.

37
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:57,750
He wasn't trying to break

38
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,109
anything or steal anything.

39
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:01,670
He just wanted to talk

40
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,149
to Emily.

41
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,310
Did he have the gun

42
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:03,750
in his hand?

43
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,590
And every time, the whole

44
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,329
time he was talking?

45
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:05,730
Yes.

46
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,689
That's when mom and dad

47
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:08,230
came home.

48
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:09,349
He ran outside.

49
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:12,129
Me and Emily trying to

50
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:12,510
get free.

51
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,370
And that's when we heard

52
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,629
the first gunshot.

53
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,299
Still at that point, I

54
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,280
thought he had fired off

55
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,379
a shot to scare somebody.

56
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,739
And then I heard a

57
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:25,519
second one in a different

58
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:25,980
place.

59
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:28,519
Before I could think, he

60
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:31,359
runs back inside, doesn't say

61
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,540
a word, and shoots Emily.

62
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:35,269
He's out of bullets.

63
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,730
He reloads.

64
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,469
And I made my move.

65
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,219
I pushed him back up

66
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:42,000
against the wall.

67
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,480
As soon as he broke

68
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,980
away, bam.

69
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,590
It was just that quick.
