00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:43,280
terms, proper nouns, and punctuation.

3
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,500
I know what you guys

4
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,439

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,480

00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:26,790

8
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,859
Where's the emergency? What's happening

9
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:44,890

10
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,159

11
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,969
What is your name, please?

12
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:52,450
Okay, you need to talk

13
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,049
to a medical dispatcher. Hold

14
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:55,709

15
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,230
Okay, get them here now.

16
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:02,849
Okay, we're sending calls. We're

17
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:04,290
sending calls right now.

18
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,450
What part of the body

19
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,310
was she shot? I don't

20
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,639
know. Just hurry up. Okay,

21
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,199
is she awake?

22
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,180
Listen to me. We've got

23
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,860
help coming right now, okay?

24
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:19,810
Okay, hurry up. Are you

25
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,530
next to her that

26
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,110
you can start CPR? No.

27
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,280
Or if you can help

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,319
her. Then don't do that,

29
00:02:32,379 --> 00:03:01,560
okay? Careful. St. Paul Police.

30
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,509
See the bullet hole? It's

31
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:05,750
the cops. Open the door.

32
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,599
Police. Come in. Come in.

33
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,060
Come in. Hurry. Hurry. Don't

34
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,139
call. Hurry.

35
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,039
I don't know how many

36
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:42,199
people are up there. Don't

37
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:57,990
let them come out. She's

38
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,849
right on the ground.

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,620
We'll just need one medic

40
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,669
to come up. Yeah, I

41
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:20,300
see that. There's one. Watch

42
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:20,579
where you're

43
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:41,550
stepping. Here, one victim's right

44
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,009
here. One victim. She's got

45
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:44,209
a wound right under the

46
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:44,449
eye.

47
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,170
Do we have one more?

48
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,050
Just one. Just one. Okay.

49
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,089
Open the door. You could

50
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:49,430
just stay out, because he

51
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,970
has to just, you know

52
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,389
what I'm saying?

53
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:56,259
Okay. Where is she, bud?

54
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,199
She's right here. She was

55
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,600
unresponsive when we arrived. She

56
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:01,819
what?

57
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,339
Unresponsive. She's right here. She

58
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,079
passed away. I mean, it's

59
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,560
traumatic. It's a traumatic arrest.

60
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:13,009
Whatever you guys want to

61
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:14,430
do. Oh, we're done. I

62
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,600
mean, she is. It's a

63
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,439
bullet hole, right?

64
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:24,009
Right. It's a traumatic arrest.

65
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,069
She has a PA of

66
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:28,600
about 30. Yeah, we're just

67
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,220
calling it.

68
00:05:29,680 --> 00:06:01,779
No, I just, maybe she

69
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:02,879
called it to love it.

70
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,709
I will work on getting

71
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:09,350
you a name. Just being

72
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,970
tight for you.

73
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,139
They walked through the house,

74
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,379
the porch, they banged on

75
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:33,839
the door. We asked who

76
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,279
was it.

77
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,220
They didn't say nothing.

78
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,060
What did you guys see?

79
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:38,019
White GMC. I swear to

80
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:38,779
God, white GMC.

81
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,620
White GMC?

82
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:39,959
Yes.

83
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,180
Did you see who shot?

84
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,439
Newer, older?

85
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:44,519
I just said he saw

86
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,819
a white GMC.

87
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,360
I don't know.

88
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:46,660
Okay.

89
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:47,040
All right.

90
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,279
Hold on.

91
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:47,379
Hold on.

92
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,060
Just stay.

93
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:48,500
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:48,980
Just stay here.

95
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:49,300
Okay.

96
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,949
365.

97
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:52,290
You're lying.

98
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,790
Suspects came in a white

99
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,490
GMC truck.

100
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,069
That's JJ's dad.

101
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,910
I just said that.

102
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:57,350
Oh, my God.

103
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:58,750
Oh, my God.

104
00:06:58,829 --> 00:06:59,470
Did you see who the

105
00:06:59,470 --> 00:06:59,850
shooter was?

106
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,279
Okay.

107
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:03,060
We had an incident here

108
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,360
a few days ago.

109
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,040
What's his name?

110
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,720
And my brother's friend, he

111
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,220
had died in the incident.

112
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,300
And that was his dad

113
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,079
that just came and shot

114
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,420
my mom.

115
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,120
His dad?

116
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:11,680
What's his name?

117
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:12,079
You know.

118
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:13,639
His name is Terrell Johnson.

119
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,519
That's his name?

120
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,279
Terrell Darrell Johnson.

121
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,819
Terrell Darrell Johnson.

122
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:18,939
Terrell Darrell Johnson.

123
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,839
And did you see him?

124
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,459
What?

125
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,430
Did you see him?

126
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,170
No, we didn't see him.

127
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,009
Why do you think it's

128
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:24,089
him?

129
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:25,829
Because I know his truck.

130
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:26,610
Because his truck.

131
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:27,029
I know his truck.

132
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:27,529
I know.

133
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:28,569
I swear I know.

134
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,290
I'm not going to.

135
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:29,610
I know.

136
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,529
How old is this?

137
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:31,529
How old is Terrell?

138
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,290
I don't know how old

139
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:32,569
he is.

140
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,089
Is he older?

141
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:33,790
I mean, is he 20?

142
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,350
Is he 40?

143
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:35,009
We don't know.

144
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:35,949
We don't know.

145
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,089
What did you guys see

146
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:38,329
in here?

147
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:40,069
We didn't see or hear

148
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:40,410
anything.

149
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:40,750
Nothing?

150
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:41,509
Were you guys here?

151
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:42,329
Yes.

152
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:42,850
Okay.

153
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:44,170
We was just up there

154
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,189
playing board games.

155
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:45,490
Okay.

156
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,970
We was just playing board

157
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:47,250
games.

158
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:47,529
Yeah.

159
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:49,129
Then somebody knocked on her

160
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:49,310
door.

161
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:50,069
She went to go see

162
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:50,790
who it was, and they

163
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,310
shot her.

164
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:51,750
Okay.

165
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,319
And then you saw the

166
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,740
white GMC take off?

167
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,920
Which way did it go?

168
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:57,810
It went this way.

169
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,930
The car was parked this

170
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,069
way.

171
00:07:59,310 --> 00:07:59,470
Yeah.

172
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,329
Was this the touch -on?

173
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:00,889
That way towards Bain?

174
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:01,589
Yes, it went this way.

175
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,110
Touch -on.

176
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:03,230
I can't see past the

177
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:03,649
stop sign.

178
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,110
Okay.

179
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,579
I can't see past, like,

180
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:07,579
the ballot room.

181
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,519
If I can see the

182
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,100
pizza store, I can see

183
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,279
that.

184
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,120
Yes, the house is clear.

185
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:15,019
I haven't gone back there

186
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:15,180
yet.

187
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,639
Have you guys?

188
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,720
Terrell Johnson.

189
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:20,860
Terrell.

190
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,939
Terrell Darrell Johnson.

191
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:23,779
After G .J. got shot.

192
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,120
Yes.

193
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:24,660
Yes.

194
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,379
Everybody's number.

195
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,600
Oh, my God.

196
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:29,259
I already did.

197
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:31,060
When was the last time

198
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,319
you guys saw each other?

199
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:33,620
I haven't seen Darnell at

200
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:33,879
all.

201
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,039
You got to know.

202
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,279
What the fuck?

203
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,860
Oh, my God.

204
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:37,879
I don't know.

205
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,840
That's G .J.

206
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,360
That's G .J.

207
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,279
I can't see him.

208
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,159
I can't see him.

209
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,419
I can't see him.

210
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,419
I can't see him.

211
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:43,519
I can't see him.

212
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,320
I can't see him.

213
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,080
I can't see him.

214
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:45,440
I can't see him.

215
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:45,820
I can't see him.

216
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,379
I can't see him.

217
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,259
I can't see him.

218
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,360
I can't see him.

219
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,919
I can't see him.

220
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:54,500
Do you know where Terrell

221
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:54,720
lives?

222
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,820
No, I don't.

223
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,559
He said it was a

224
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,019
white game.

225
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:02,970
It's like a...

226
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,789
It's like Chuck.

227
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:04,370
Right.

228
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,899
That's the last time you

229
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:07,220
saw him.

230
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:08,639
Was there anything that you

231
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,120
saw about...

232
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,340
Like, was it a new...

233
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:10,899
I don't know how long.

234
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,679
Was it new, old...

235
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,759
It was like a new

236
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,159
arrangement.

237
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,220
Oh, yeah.

238
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,120
I don't know.

239
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,399
I can't see, but it

240
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:21,539
was...

241
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:22,820
Like a big, like a

242
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,759
full -size SUV?

243
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,539
Yeah, when they're done.

244
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:25,700
Okay.

245
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,080
My bad.

246
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:29,740
I didn't mean to call

247
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:29,879
you.

248
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,320
What do you think?

249
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:31,700
What do you think?

250
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,179
When was the last time

251
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:33,200
you saw that car parked

252
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,440
outside?

253
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,500
About, like, a few days

254
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:35,799
ago.

255
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:37,840
Right after JJ got trapped?

256
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:40,289
Have you seen it at

257
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:40,809
all today?

258
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:45,120
This was private, bro.

259
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,919
You have to think about

260
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:47,919
it.

261
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,220
He came here one day,

262
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,580
tried to come in.

263
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,440
Nobody opened the door.

264
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,080
Then he just came back.
