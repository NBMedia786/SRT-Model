1
00:00:01,389 --> 00:00:03,509
An all -new 2020 starts

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:04,370
right now.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,550
Family secrets are spilling out.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,150
I need my daddy.

5
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:14,470
A teenager with a strange

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,130
demeanor.

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,710
She's clutching a teddy bear.

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,530
How can she be actually

9
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,609
18 years of age?

10
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,410
And an even stranger story

11
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,170
about her missing mother.

12
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,690
I didn't know Bonnie was

13
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,629
going to go missing.

14
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:27,510
Something happened to her.

15
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,730
She didn't just disappear on

16
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,670
her own free will.

17
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,829
So you knew something was

18
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:32,450
really wrong.

19
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,649
No. Pretty much.

20
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,149
Has she ever disappeared before?

21
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:35,549
No.

22
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,109
Whoever has my sister, please

23
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:39,929
let her go.

24
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,570
Maybe somebody saw her somewhere

25
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,609
at a bus station, at

26
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:43,770
a train station, in a

27
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,609
cab, at the mall.

28
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:46,490
Nathan, you can agree to

29
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,570
walk us through a few

30
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:47,969
areas.

31
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,310
We're running out of time.

32
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,649
He said at times, I

33
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:51,469
feel like I have the

34
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:52,630
devil living inside me.

35
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,530
Turns out, Bonnie wasn't the

36
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,810
only missing person in that

37
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,229
household.

38
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,239
Police at Alton need the

39
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,540
public's help finding a missing

40
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:07,939
woman.

41
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,879
Bonnie Woodward was last seen.

42
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,920
It's a missing person's case

43
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,400
that will confound an Illinois

44
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,840
community.

45
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:16,680
I didn't see any...

46
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,060
Flooding, seasoned investigators with no

47
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,019
shortage of witnesses.

48
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,739
And then possibly tried to

49
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:22,159
get rid of her.

50
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,159
These interviews happening in this

51
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,099
room right here.

52
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,319
Focusing on one person, one

53
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,099
mother of four,

54
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,719
whose sudden and perplexing disappearance

55
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,939
sets off alarm bells.

56
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:34,719
It all started at the

57
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,719
end of a day's shift

58
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,120
one afternoon in June.

59
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,730
Bonnie Woodward got off around

60
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,230
3pm.

61
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:54,099
That day, she was working

62
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:54,859
at what was called a

63
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:56,159
Unismith nursing home here in

64
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:56,500
Alton.

65
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,939
It was a normal day

66
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:00,760
of work for her.

67
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,629
47 years old, worked at

68
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:07,450
the nursing home for over

69
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,930
25 years, I believe.

70
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,169
And just a woman who

71
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:12,469
was reliable.

72
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:14,090
Being a nurse's aide is,

73
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:15,590
that's a lot of caregiving.

74
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,490
She had it forever.

75
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:17,909
She loved what she did.

76
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:19,189
She went to work, she

77
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:20,550
worked her shift, and then

78
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,509
would come home to her

79
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:22,430
children every night.

80
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,539
As well as...

81
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,099
Gary Wilmorth, who she was

82
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,039
dating at the time.

83
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,620
Gary knew that she had

84
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,259
some sort of staff meeting

85
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:32,319
after work from 2 to

86
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,539
3.

87
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:34,560
So he really wasn't expecting

88
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,120
her home until, you know,

89
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,580
3 .34.

90
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:41,449
That boyfriend, Gary Wilmorth, says

91
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:42,610
he tries getting a hold

92
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,770
of Bonnie around 4 o

93
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,030
'clock.

94
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,699
But his call goes straight

95
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:47,400
to voicemail.

96
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,840
Your call has been forwarded

97
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,319
to an automatic voice message

98
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:50,659
system.

99
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,199
Everybody was like, she would

100
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,419
call if she was five

101
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:53,800
minutes away.

102
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,639
Oh no, she was, everything

103
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,560
she did was on a

104
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:55,919
schedule.

105
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,090
Nobody had seen her.

106
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,490
This was very abnormal for

107
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:00,750
Bonnie.

108
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,469
She was always in communication

109
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:03,689
with her family.

110
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,939
After she didn't return home,

111
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,639
her family members, they reached

112
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:08,960
out.

113
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,199
They tried to call her,

114
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,099
they tried to text her,

115
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:11,979
and no response.

116
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,849
And by the next morning,

117
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,150
when Bonnie doesn't show up

118
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,610
for work,

119
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,189
her co -workers are alarmed

120
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:19,409
by something they see in

121
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:19,990
the parking lot.

122
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:22,169
Her red Chevy Avalanche was

123
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,509
still parked at the nursing

124
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:24,830
home, had not moved from

125
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,629
the previous date.

126
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:27,449
The windows had been down,

127
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,229
even during the overnight hours.

128
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,400
She loved that truck.

129
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,259
She worked really hard to

130
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:33,719
get that truck.

131
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,860
She absolutely loved it.

132
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,539
So she wouldn't have just

133
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:36,939
left it.

134
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,680
At that point, it was

135
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,280
clear that there was something

136
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,599
wrong.

137
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:43,580
And Gary reported her disappearance

138
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,879
to our department the morning

139
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,740
of the 26th.

140
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,159
When we work on the

141
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,199
missing person and we're dealing

142
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:50,840
with an adult,

143
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,979
you have to keep in

144
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:53,300
mind the possibility if they

145
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,840
just want to take a

146
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,139
break.

147
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,180
They want to get away

148
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,139
from family and friends.

149
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:58,039
And that's natural.

150
00:03:58,419 --> 00:03:59,560
Also, I have to look

151
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,860
into what's usual and what's

152
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,680
their history.

153
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,400
Detectives assigned to the case

154
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,580
soon learn that 47 -year

155
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,080
-old Bonnie Woodward is a

156
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,919
force of nature.

157
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,439
Bonnie survived breast cancer.

158
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:15,780
She was a fierce mother

159
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,939
to four children.

160
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,500
Bonnie has two grown children

161
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,540
from her first marriage.

162
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,319
Joseph, who's 28, and Jennifer,

163
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:23,819
26.

164
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,100
Bonnie is also mom to

165
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,899
two stepkids, Heather and Aaron.

166
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,019
She adopted them after their

167
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,040
father, Bonnie's third husband, passed

168
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,339
away.

169
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:34,819
Heather was about 17 years

170
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:35,779
old at this time.

171
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:38,879
And Aaron was special needs,

172
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,560
and she cared for him

173
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,079
every day.

174
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,860
Bonnie is also a devoted

175
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,360
grandmother.

176
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,720
She grew up as one

177
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,180
of nine siblings, so she

178
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,779
has a large extended family.

179
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,389
What kind of aunt was

180
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:51,610
she?

181
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,310
She was the aunt that

182
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,009
took a second to actually

183
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:57,009
listen to you if something

184
00:04:57,009 --> 00:04:57,750
was going on.

185
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,370
And she had a big

186
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:58,750
personality.

187
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,269
Oh, yeah, no, huge personality.

188
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:02,800
Very loving.

189
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,399
Her house is where a

190
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,259
lot of the cousins all

191
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:07,300
congregated.

192
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,819
She had this little case

193
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:11,360
in her living room, and

194
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,379
she'd have little figurines and

195
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,240
random stuff that had dolphins

196
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,800
on it.

197
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,980
None of it made sense

198
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,879
to me, but she loved

199
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,079
them.

200
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,220
So she was the social

201
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,560
hub.

202
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:22,759
Kind of, yeah.

203
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:24,439
She kind of liked having

204
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,040
everybody around.

205
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,279
So you knew something was

206
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:26,819
really wrong.

207
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:27,920
Pretty much.

208
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:32,259
With the clock ticking,

209
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:34,220
the Auden detectives start their

210
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,139
missing person investigation where you'd

211
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:36,399
expect,

212
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,079
at the last place she

213
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,220
was reportedly seen.

214
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,180
This is where Bonnie worked?

215
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:43,339
Yes, this Unismith nursing home.

216
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,660
And she was a very

217
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,600
consistent employee.

218
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,339
Yes, didn't miss any work

219
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:49,060
at all, and certainly wouldn't

220
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,500
miss without calling in.

221
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,259
And so where was her

222
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:52,879
car parked?

223
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,819
It was in the spots

224
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:55,160
here.

225
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,029
And the windows were rolled

226
00:05:58,029 --> 00:05:58,269
down?

227
00:05:58,589 --> 00:05:59,769
Yeah, windows were rolled down.

228
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,829
So you would have to

229
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:02,129
imagine that she expected to

230
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:02,850
come back to the hospital.

231
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:03,069
Yeah.

232
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,170
Back here, presumably, no surveillance

233
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,769
was captured.

234
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:07,410
No.

235
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,850
At that time, there was

236
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,269
no surveillance back here that

237
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,610
we could rely on.

238
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,819
Without any surveillance footage, officers

239
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:17,319
are hopeful that Bonnie's car

240
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,639
may actually give them some

241
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,000
clues as to what may

242
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,500
or may not have happened.

243
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:24,139
The vehicle, there's no significant

244
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:25,360
damage to it or anything

245
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,319
like that that would cause

246
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,379
us any alarm.

247
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,000
And upon looking at the

248
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,360
inside, there was no evidence

249
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,040
of a struggle.

250
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,560
So we ended up having

251
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,639
this vehicle towed to our

252
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,180
police department, secured, until we

253
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,620
could process it, and also

254
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,579
dust it for prints.

255
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:41,439
One of the early things

256
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,860
was how Bonnie Woodward was

257
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,360
really regular with cashing her

258
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,699
paycheck.

259
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,139
The day she disappeared was

260
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:49,139
payday, and she would, every

261
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,120
time she was paid on

262
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,259
Fridays, she would take that

263
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:51,959
check to the bank.

264
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,040
That was a ritual?

265
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:53,660
Ritual.

266
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:55,300
The check never got cash,

267
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,100
she never went to the

268
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,319
bank.

269
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:59,779
Nothing happened with any of

270
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:02,240
her phone, social media.

271
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,500
Bank accounts all went dead

272
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,839
as of 4 p .m.

273
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,139
that day.

274
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:09,550
And so then we have

275
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,850
to look at what other

276
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,250
troubles that she may have

277
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,269
in her life.

278
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:14,610
We have to look at

279
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,610
prior relationships.

280
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:17,550
We have to look at

281
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,389
Gary Wilmarth, her current boyfriend.

282
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,850
And so what did you

283
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:21,790
find when you dug into

284
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,389
Gary's background?

285
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,910
Gary's got a colorful past.

286
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:27,310
He's a convicted felon, and

287
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,910
they've had some domestic issues.

288
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,699
And just for the record,

289
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:38,439
sir, what is your name,

290
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:38,879
your full name?

291
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,180
Gary.

292
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,240
J -A -R -Y.

293
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:40,920
Okay.

294
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,040
Wilmarth, W -I -L -M

295
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,240
-U -R -T -H.

296
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,519
Bonnie was the love of

297
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,009
my life, and she was

298
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:48,829
a good -hearted woman.

299
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:51,540
And, I mean, she put

300
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,639
up with me, and, I

301
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,540
mean, that wasn't easy.

302
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:56,170
When Gary's talking to police,

303
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,290
he tells them that they've

304
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,170
been an on -and -off

305
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,709
couple for about seven years.

306
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:01,290
Everything good over the past

307
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,490
ten months between you two?

308
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,310
Yeah.

309
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,850
Ever any arguments or fights

310
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,470
or plastics?

311
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,350
No, just a little money

312
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,589
problem, you know, because construction's

313
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:08,829
slow.

314
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,189
Right.

315
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,350
But we've been working it

316
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:10,449
out.

317
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:11,250
I mean, I'm not a

318
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:11,709
good boy.

319
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:12,569
I mean, I've had a

320
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:14,230
record myself in the past.

321
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,089
I've paid my time, and

322
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:17,029
Bonnie knew that.

323
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,089
Bonnie still loved me.

324
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:19,410
She didn't care what I

325
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,149
did in my past.

326
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,970
And, uh, these cops sure

327
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,230
did.

328
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:24,709
Have you heard anything from

329
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:25,490
her at all since then?

330
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:25,730
Nothing.

331
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:26,029
Nothing.

332
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:26,170
Nothing.

333
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,790
Bonnie's daughter, Jennifer, alibied him

334
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,209
at home.

335
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,709
And Gary was waiting for

336
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,470
her to get home because...

337
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,250
She said they were both

338
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,429
there the whole day together.

339
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,629
And, ultimately, he did end

340
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:37,830
up doing a polygraph examination

341
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,529
and passed it.

342
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,870
But as investigators start talking

343
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,850
to Bonnie's coworkers,

344
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,350
they learn she was last

345
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,470
seen getting into a strange

346
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:45,830
car

347
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,309
with an unknown man.

348
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:48,690
I guess I had never

349
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,789
seen the man before.

350
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,730
The police wondered, could Bonnie

351
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,649
be having an affair?

352
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,309
Or was it something worse?

353
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,549
Nothing is out of the

354
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:57,289
realm of possibility.

355
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:58,610
How did she know this

356
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,070
person?

357
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:01,330
I mean, Mom had to

358
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,230
have known the person she

359
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,409
got into the car with.
