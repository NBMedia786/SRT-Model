1
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:13,110
My partner's going to kind

2
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,849
of talk to you about

3
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:14,250
what you're doing.

4
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:14,729
Do you have any idea

5
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:15,250
what I don't hear?

6
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:17,020
I do.

7
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,490
Tell me about that.

8
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,009
So, my kid gets shots

9
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:23,689
in the face.

10
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:24,530
What's his name?

11
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:26,189
Terrell Johnson, man.

12
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:26,590
Okay.

13
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:28,110
So, my kid gets shot

14
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,849
in the face.

15
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,199
The guy that shot him,

16
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,419
his mother, gets injured or

17
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:36,800
whatever,

18
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,919
and the kid said to

19
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,979
my kid's mother,

20
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:44,900
well, it might be your

21
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,360
dad that killed my mom.

22
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,259
I'm not killing nobody, man.

23
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,729
My son got shot, man.

24
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,750
That's it, man.

25
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,969
My son got shot.

26
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:56,650
That's it.

27
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:58,449
I just bypassed.

28
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:59,349
That's it.

29
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:00,849
They know that.

30
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,310
Man, they know how I

31
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,689
look and everything, man.

32
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:06,449
They know how I look.

33
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:07,430
They asked that lady,

34
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,770
hey, how do your baby

35
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,449
daddy look?

36
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,270
They know how I look.

37
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:14,090
Tell me about when you

38
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:14,770
said you bypassed.

39
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:15,770
What does that mean?

40
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,460
Since my sons got shot,

41
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,520
I bypassed, and I go

42
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:22,860
see.

43
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,139
I asked it.

44
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,400
They told me and my

45
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,060
kid's mother.

46
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,580
They didn't want to tell

47
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,599
us a story about what

48
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,419
happened to my kid.

49
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,759
We don't feel like talking

50
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,360
right now.

51
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,289
And I said, okay, well,

52
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:37,969
I'll come to you, and

53
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:39,430
I'll bypass every day.

54
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,289
I mean, we cool.

55
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:42,150
I'm like you guys' dad

56
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,650
as well.

57
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,110
Yeah.

58
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,370
Why wouldn't you want to

59
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:44,909
talk to me?

60
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,409
Yeah.

61
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:46,289
That's it.

62
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:47,229
You guys have known each

63
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:47,849
other a long time.

64
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:48,310
Yeah.

65
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,650
They played on my son's

66
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,009
basketball team for seven years,

67
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:51,229
man.

68
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:51,530
Okay.

69
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,509
That's a chunk.

70
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,120
Yeah.

71
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:15,000
It's kind of weird that

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,279
I'm here.

73
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,079
I read the signs and

74
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,300
stuff, and I'm like,

75
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:24,050
this is some stuff, man,

76
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,189
pertaining to kids, man.

77
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,209
That ain't my lifestyle.

78
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,269
You understand me?

79
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,610
Is it not right to

80
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,009
me this isn't the first

81
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:36,490
time that this has happened

82
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:36,930
over here?

83
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:38,069
Right.

84
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,470
My son's been shot once

85
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,110
before in McDonough Projects from

86
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,170
her house.

87
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,180
Okay.

88
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:45,959
Right.

89
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,019
Their house gets shot up

90
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:50,420
in Mount Airy.

91
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,439
Oh, I'm telling my son

92
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,300
every time,

93
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:55,990
why would you hang with

94
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,689
somebody that has brothers?

95
00:04:58,009 --> 00:04:59,529
You don't hang with three

96
00:04:59,529 --> 00:04:59,870
brothers.

97
00:04:59,870 --> 00:04:59,949
You don't hang with your

98
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:00,189
mother, son.

99
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,670
He's three friends and a

100
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,069
stranger.

101
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,810
He don't get it until

102
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,149
this happens to him.

103
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:07,910
He gets shot in the

104
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,230
face.

105
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,759
It hurt my heart to

106
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,019
death.

107
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,339
It hurt me and my

108
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:13,720
family.

109
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,399
But I'm not doing nothing

110
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,319
with no lady, my man.

111
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,579
I'm an adult.

112
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:21,939
If I'm going to do

113
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:22,800
something, it's going to be

114
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,920
the dude that did something

115
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,620
to my child.

116
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:26,139
I still feel that same

117
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:26,459
way.

118
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,980
I want him to die

119
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,620
before me.

120
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,680
I want that.

121
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,240
Yeah.

122
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:30,720
Yeah.

123
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,509
He hurt my child.

124
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,230
But I'm not going to

125
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,269
hurt nobody, man.

126
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,110
So I'm going to need

127
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,209
to be at homicide.

128
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,370
Okay.

129
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:39,970
All right.

130
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:58,379
You said you just drive

131
00:05:58,379 --> 00:05:58,839
by them.

132
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,319
Have you tried to make

133
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,439
contact with them there?

134
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,519
Yes, we have.

135
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,259
We got text messages and

136
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:05,980
everything, man.

137
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,639
Tell me about that.

138
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:08,459
We text them and ask

139
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:09,420
them the story.

140
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,180
Who is them?

141
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,480
Mari.

142
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,620
Mari is the oldest son.

143
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:15,079
Okay.

144
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,819
She has like three boys.

145
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,319
And they're all the same

146
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:18,899
age group.

147
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:19,480
My son.

148
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:21,529
If you go on Facebook,

149
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:22,670
this is what they said.

150
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,069
They said.

151
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,230
So we didn't know a

152
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,550
story.

153
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:24,990
Okay.

154
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,920
My son is, he was

155
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,819
so messed up that he

156
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:30,839
couldn't talk for a while.

157
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,579
So he couldn't say a

158
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:33,639
story or he didn't do

159
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:33,959
anything.

160
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,370
And I'm not with his

161
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:37,689
mother.

162
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:39,990
And when I go down

163
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,089
there, they didn't let me

164
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:42,170
in because.

165
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,050
Down at the hospital?

166
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:43,629
Yeah.

167
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:43,970
Okay.

168
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:47,300
Her other, her boyfriend is

169
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,439
there, but her husband, you

170
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,579
know, because they've been together

171
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:50,379
for about six years.

172
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:52,199
But they didn't let me

173
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:52,620
in, whatever.

174
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:53,519
I sat down there.

175
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,600
Me and the guy get

176
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,319
into an altercation.

177
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,079
The husband?

178
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:01,899
Yeah.

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,199
Okay.

180
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,860
And I go on Facebook.

181
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,180
I'm angry.

182
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:07,740
I'm upset.

183
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:10,500
I say her name on

184
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,060
the thing and everything.

185
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,100
I say his name as

186
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,300
well.

187
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,060
The next day, she contacts

188
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,860
my mother.

189
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,560
And we, me and her

190
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,339
are talking without him.

191
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:22,860
And she's telling me how

192
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,279
she.

193
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:24,680
Uh, talk to him and

194
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:24,879
stuff.

195
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:25,800
And then I'm telling her

196
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,500
while I ride past her

197
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,060
all the time.

198
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:28,800
And I see the little

199
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,160
dudes standing out there and,

200
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,040
you know what I mean?

201
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:32,540
I, I, you know, I

202
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,399
asked them and they told

203
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,199
me the same thing, right?

204
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:37,279
I'm like, they going to

205
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,699
talk, he going to actually

206
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,019
just wait till JJ come

207
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:41,360
around.

208
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,980
When JJ came around, um,

209
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,939
the little guys, they keep

210
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:48,980
texting them and stuff.

211
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,420
Right.

212
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,680
And like, um, trying to

213
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,160
give him a story.

214
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,470
Because Jarrell was supposed to

215
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,209
be unconscious or something to

216
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:01,529
where he didn't know what

217
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:01,970
happened.

218
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,470
So they're trying to give

219
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:03,990
him a story.

220
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:04,589
Okay.

221
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,350
He says, the lady come

222
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,509
in and she keeps saying,

223
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:08,670
is you going to tell

224
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,670
him my son or something

225
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,329
or, um, giving him the

226
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:12,689
story?

227
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,769
And she said, I'm going

228
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:15,490
to tell the police that

229
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,759
you came here.

230
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,360
Don't tell him that you

231
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,660
got shot here or something.

232
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,350
He was saying, right?

233
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,610
And when you say the

234
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,370
lady, who are you talking

235
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:25,550
about?

236
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:26,209
Um.

237
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,569
The lady you're telling, you

238
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:28,689
said the lady's telling him

239
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:29,370
the story.

240
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:30,290
The lady, he said it's

241
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:30,589
a lady.

242
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,509
It's a, it's an adult

243
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:32,549
at the house.

244
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:32,990
Okay.

245
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:33,830
As well.

246
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:36,250
So she's telling him that,

247
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,720
um, don't tell the cops

248
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,500
that he got shot here.

249
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,779
There at that house.

250
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:43,779
Exactly.

251
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:45,419
That's it.

252
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:46,580
That's all we knew.

253
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,220
That's the only story he

254
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,399
said.

255
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,059
And I said, well, and

256
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:51,419
like I told her, I

257
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:55,059
said, um, my son doesn't

258
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:56,539
want to tell the police.

259
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,610
And she, I guess, wants

260
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,730
to protect his reputation.

261
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:06,190
That's not my plan, man.

262
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,210
Right?

263
00:09:07,309 --> 00:09:08,769
I've been shot here two

264
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:09,070
times.

265
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,220
I'm an important guy.

266
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:12,419
You do something to me,

267
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,279
you going to jail.

268
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,299
Right?

269
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:15,519
If I, if I do

270
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,480
something, I'm going to own

271
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,100
up to it, man.

272
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,179
I ain't did nothing right.

273
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,200
And it ain't right.

274
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
It's not right.

275
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,620
How Minnesota doing, man?

276
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,000

277
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,320
