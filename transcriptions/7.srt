1
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,929
I'm fighting. I'm fighting with

2
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:12,150
everything that's within me.

3
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,050
What are you thinking at

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:14,570
the time?

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,230
What am I thinking? I'm

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,210
thinking I'm going to die.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,449
Roger Carroll had been charged

8
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:21,350
with obstruction of justice in

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,750
the disappearance of Bonnie Woodward.

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,890
But now, eight years later,

11
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,469
he's being accused of something

12
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:27,269
else altogether.

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,570
By, of all people, his

14
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,190
wife of over 30 years,

15
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:31,969
Monica.

16
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:35,219
In March of 2018, we

17
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,840
received information from the Jersey

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,939
County Sheriff's Department

19
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:39,539
that there was a domestic

20
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,799
situation in which Roger had

21
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:42,920
caused injury to Monica.

22
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,189
I didn't know his connection.

23
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,869
I didn't know this was

24
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:50,409
the Bonnie Woodward suspect.

25
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,039
So I went the next

26
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,200
day and met her several

27
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,399
hours from here where she

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,619
was kind of hyped out.

29
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,179
Okay, we are recording.

30
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,280
He told me I was

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,239
fat, disgusting, so fat and

32
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,659
disgusting that nobody would want

33
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:08,500
to have anything to do

34
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:08,920
with me.

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,700
The first thing you notice?

36
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:10,840
The first thing you notice

37
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,519
on the dash cam is

38
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,780
A, the injuries to her

39
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,840
face, and B, beyond the

40
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,840
injuries, just the fear.

41
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,659
She said for the most

42
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:20,340
part it was a good

43
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,180
marriage until there was some

44
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,760
infidelity like a few years

45
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,060
prior.

46
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:25,959
She had recently figured out

47
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,680
more infidelity and then had

48
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,340
filed for divorce.

49
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:32,099
He was really withdrawn after

50
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:33,920
serving with the divorce papers.

51
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,340
I thought he would be

52
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,620
happy because just a couple

53
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,780
weeks before he said, I

54
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,359
want a divorce.

55
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,239
They had separate bedrooms.

56
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,980
But while she slept in

57
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,840
her bedroom, she not only

58
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,819
locked the door, but she

59
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:46,040
put a dresser up against

60
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,060
the door because she was

61
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,299
scared.

62
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,079
Monica tells Detective Nick Manns

63
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,459
about the alleged attack in

64
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:52,920
which, as she's getting ready

65
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,500
for work,

66
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,400
she says Roger corners her

67
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,340
in the laundry room.

68
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,159
Roger is looking out the

69
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,299
garage door, like making sure

70
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:03,060
Nathan has left.

71
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:06,939
And he turned and he

72
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:08,199
acted like he was going

73
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,159
to have normal conversation.

74
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,330
And he reached over to

75
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:12,530
the back of the car.

76
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:12,550
He was looking at me

77
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:12,710
from the back of my

78
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,389
head, grabbed my hair, and

79
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:17,889
jerked me and then dragging

80
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:18,949
me around by my hair

81
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:20,770
with his right hand, he

82
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,229
was hitting me in the

83
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:23,449
head with the taser gun.

84
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,629
And how do you know

85
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:25,389
it was a taser gun?

86
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,270
What was it doing?

87
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:28,710
Because it shocked me.

88
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:30,789
So he drags it up

89
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:31,069
your neck?

90
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,469
He drags it up my

91
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:32,710
neck.

92
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,469
He looked shocked.

93
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,669
And I was screaming, Roger,

94
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,430
don't do this. Roger, don't

95
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:42,870
do this.

96
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,789
I started screaming, Nathan, Nathan.

97
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:48,129
Screaming for Nathan as hard

98
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:48,650
as I could.

99
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:50,509
Screaming for help.

100
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:53,469
Nathan, unfortunately, had already left

101
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:54,530
early for work.

102
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,189
So then I knew all

103
00:02:56,189 --> 00:02:57,110
my help was gone.

104
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:02,069
And I remember when he

105
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:03,889
hit me up here. He

106
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,310
hit me and drug.

107
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,349
And the shocked look on

108
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:08,930
his face.

109
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:11,370
I said, God, Roger, stop

110
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,650
it. Just stop doing this.

111
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,930
Let me go. Just let

112
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,189
me go. I'll do anything

113
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:18,229
you want me to do.

114
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:19,169
Just let me go.

115
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:24,270
And he had this shocked

116
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,310
look on his face.

117
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,280
It's like he was surprised

118
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,379
that I was still talking.

119
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,900
Monica says she somehow manages

120
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,740
to get a hold of

121
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,379
the taser and throws it

122
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:39,259
into the next room.

123
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,240
You still have some abrasion,

124
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,699
some little swelling there.

125
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,370
I had blood. Pretty much

126
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,530
every place that these things

127
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,810
are, I had blood smeared.

128
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,430
All these red marks are

129
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,509
from your fight with him.

130
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:54,110
These are from him.

131
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:56,110
During this time, Monica does

132
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,349
what so many victims unfortunately

133
00:03:58,349 --> 00:03:59,610
have to do, but it's

134
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,550
a survival thing.

135
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:02,909
How am I going to

136
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:03,710
get out of this situation?

137
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:06,090
And she starts to deescalate

138
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,870
it slowly, verbally deescalate the

139
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,210
situation.

140
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:11,770
I was just thinking, don't

141
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,569
get him agitated. Talk him

142
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:13,849
down.

143
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:17,449
And I said, Roger, you've

144
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:18,170
been a good dad.

145
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,000
You were a good husband.

146
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,240
But you're not the man.

147
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,079
He said that I married

148
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,139
30 years ago.

149
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,949
And he'd said it before.

150
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:28,910
He said, I know.

151
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,009
I'm not that same person.

152
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:32,649
He said, I am a

153
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:33,110
monster.

154
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,040
He said, I have so

155
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,680
much anger and hate in

156
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:37,959
me.

157
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,399
And I can't control it

158
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:40,800
no more.

159
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:43,670
He said, at times, I

160
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,490
feel like I have the

161
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,629
devil living inside me.

162
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,459
Eventually, that got to the

163
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:49,560
point where he allowed her

164
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,100
to get up and get

165
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,160
ready for work and go.

166
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,540
As soon as I got

167
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,300
in my car, I hit

168
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,079
the lock button.

169
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,560
Put it in reverse.

170
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,829
And took out.

171
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,709
Then she provided us information

172
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:03,670
that she knew him to

173
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,670
possess firearms.

174
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,990
And she believed him to

175
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,389
be suicidal at the time.

176
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:10,629
He says, I've been thinking

177
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:11,689
about just going out into

178
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:12,610
the woods and never coming

179
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:12,949
back.

180
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:15,329
Detective Mann says he went

181
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:16,529
to search for Roger the

182
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:17,529
morning of the alleged attack.

183
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:19,490
We believe he's a danger,

184
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,129
obviously, to her and to

185
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:22,430
our community, but also to

186
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:22,709
himself.

187
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,550
So I'm driving down this

188
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:25,850
road.

189
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,589
Which is Creek Road, which

190
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:28,490
is where he lives.

191
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,649
And this is actually, that

192
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:31,709
would be his house at

193
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:32,029
the time.

194
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,569
He and Monica lived there.

195
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:35,149
That was their home.

196
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:38,040
I keep going up this

197
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,360
hill.

198
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,620
You can see it's pretty

199
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,399
rugged terrain.

200
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,470
I don't even realize at

201
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,790
that time that this is

202
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,610
his property.

203
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,670
So I go up here.

204
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,290
And I go left.

205
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,389
And I drive across this

206
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:49,730
field.

207
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,370
And I get out of

208
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:51,730
my car.

209
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:52,870
And when I get up

210
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,889
along this trail, I see

211
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:54,790
something down there.

212
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,050
And I keep moving closer.

213
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:56,870
And it's...

214
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,029
It's him.

215
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,779
Roger was lethargic.

216
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,199
I felled in his jacket

217
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,680
pocket, which turned out to

218
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,240
be a bag of needles,

219
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,480
of syringes.

220
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:08,639
Then I found a vial

221
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,459
of what I knew to

222
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:09,879
be insulin.

223
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,899
I asked him if he

224
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:12,300
was diabetic.

225
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,199
And he said no, that

226
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,819
he had hurt his wife

227
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:17,120
and that he was trying

228
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,639
to kill himself.

229
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,439
I called my dispatch and

230
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,620
said, send an ambulance this

231
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:21,860
way.

232
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,139
What's the ambulance?

233
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,540
No, this guy's not diabetic.

234
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,279
He's with insulin.

235
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,550
Attention, Brighton Road.

236
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,149
Rescue in Creek Road for

237
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:30,129
52 -year -old male.

238
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,550
Took an overdose of insulin.

239
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:32,329
The suicide attempt.

240
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,939
But what Detective Mann soon

241
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:36,439
learns is that his fellow

242
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,899
investigator, Scott Golicki,

243
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,240
has been looking at Roger

244
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,120
Carroll as Bonnie Woodward's possible

245
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,680
killer.

246
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,519
Immediately, Scott and I said,

247
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,759
the family's falling apart.

248
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,519
And we have to jump

249
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:49,879
now.

250
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,000
This is our time.

251
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,319
Because at that point, you

252
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,879
double down on every member

253
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,699
of the Carroll family.

254
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:55,800
Right.

255
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:56,959
We need a talker.

256
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,220
They need a talker.

257
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,480
And they're about to get

258
00:06:59,480 --> 00:06:59,699
one.

259
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:02,000
And investigators get a story

260
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,500
they had not prepared for.
