1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:03,950
Okay, we are recording.

2
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:06,570
I said, stop it. Just

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,929
stop doing this. Let me

4
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:10,310
go. Just let me go.

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,769
I'll do anything you want

6
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:12,730
me to do. Just let

7
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,169
me go.

8
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:16,440
Tonight, a third woman in

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,000
danger who broke the bizarre

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,879
mystery of a missing mother.

11
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,519
It didn't mean to cause

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,620
a problem. I didn't know

13
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,699
Bonnie was going to go

14
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:27,059
missing.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,879
Who's been hiding daughter Heather?

16
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:31,800
And could Bonnie have ended

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,719
up in the same place?

18
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,579
Family members must be chomping

19
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,320
at the bit at this

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:36,600
point.

21
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,719
It was a needle in

22
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:38,619
a haystack. We had 60

23
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:40,259
acres of property. We didn't

24
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:41,060
know where to look, what

25
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,640
to look for.

26
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:43,500
Nathan, you can agree to

27
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,579
walk us through a few

28
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,039
areas that are of interest

29
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:46,859
in our investigation.

30
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,020
We got a hit on

31
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,299
the prints.

32
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,820
And on a scale of

33
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,759
1 to 10 of your

34
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,000
suspicion level, where did it

35
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,179
go?

36
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,100
Yeah, it's piped.

37
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,520
Any idea what they were?

38
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:56,219
Little pieces of white things,

39
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:57,060
but I don't know exactly

40
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,740
what it was.

41
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,659
The family's falling apart, and

42
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:00,640
we have to jump now.

43
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:01,820
This is our time.

44
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,219
She now is starting to

45
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:03,479
put...

46
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,519
Everything together and is fearing

47
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,459
for her own life at

48
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:07,159
the same time.

49
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:08,859
He said, I have killed

50
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:11,019
for you. I have killed

51
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:12,480
for you.

52
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,040
That sounds like bingo.

53
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,480
Summer has turned to fall

54
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,359
in Alton, Illinois.

55
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,319
48 -year -old mom and

56
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,120
nurse's aide, Bonnie Woodward, hasn't

57
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,159
been seen in over three

58
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:34,459
months.

59
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,299
That's an eternity in a

60
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,140
missing persons case.

61
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,819
We didn't know technically if

62
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:40,579
she was alive or dead

63
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:41,519
in the months that followed.

64
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,900
None of her family members

65
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,560
heard from her.

66
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,439
But the Illinois State Police...

67
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,640
The crime lab has been

68
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,760
busy processing evidence, including fingerprints

69
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,239
found on Bonnie's truck.

70
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,180
In September, prints come in.

71
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,799
Right. I got a phone

72
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,719
call from my evidence technician

73
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,200
who told me we got

74
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,799
a hit on the prints.

75
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,500
It's Roger Carroll's.

76
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,159
So Roger Carroll's fingerprints are

77
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,219
on this driver's door.

78
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,780
And on a scale of

79
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,719
1 to 10 of your

80
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,979
suspicion level, where did it

81
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:10,159
go?

82
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,039
Yeah, it's piped.

83
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,689
Roger Carroll is brought in

84
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:14,770
again for questioning.

85
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:15,949
While police...

86
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:17,729
As a notable cause, conduct

87
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:19,189
a massive search at the

88
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:21,530
Carroll's sprawling rural residence.

89
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,319
It was a needle in

90
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,240
a haystack. We had 60

91
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,159
acres of property.

92
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,159
We didn't know where to

93
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,080
look, what to look for.

94
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,479
Neighbors are stunned by the

95
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,159
police operation.

96
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,780
It's crazy. Absolutely crazy.

97
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,680
Couldn't believe it, the amount

98
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,639
of police that were coming

99
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:36,879
by.

100
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,740
And we had more than

101
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,020
60 police officers.

102
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,120
Multiple agencies.

103
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,159
We had a lot of

104
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,400
people. We had cadaver dogs.

105
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,520
And an airborne search.

106
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,060
And an airborne search, yes.

107
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:50,020
There's probably close to 30

108
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,919
firearms at this residence.

109
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:54,719
Multiple crates of ammunition were

110
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,819
also seen.

111
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,300
Oh, I thought they was

112
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,259
going to find a body

113
00:02:59,259 --> 00:02:59,740
or something.

114
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,319
The cadaver dogs did alert

115
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,479
on certain areas of the

116
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:03,860
property.

117
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,439
But subsequent digs of those

118
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,180
areas revealed no results.

119
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:10,729
Meanwhile, this time in the

120
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:12,189
police interrogation room for a

121
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:14,370
second interview, Roger is more

122
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:14,870
chatty.

123
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:17,449
My mom, she's like, oh

124
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:18,310
my God, did you do

125
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:18,629
this?

126
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,349
Mom, no, I didn't do

127
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:20,590
it.

128
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:22,789
Roger tells investigators that he

129
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:24,729
invited Bonnie's daughter, Heather, to

130
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:25,569
stay with him and his

131
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:25,930
family.

132
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:28,150
Only after becoming concerned about

133
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,789
her account of a troubled

134
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:30,330
home life.

135
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:32,069
So then Heather calls you

136
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:32,289
guys?

137
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,069
Yes.

138
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,050
I could hear her crying.

139
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:36,490
She was just frantic, you

140
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:36,610
know.

141
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:38,710
Oh my God, Bonnie called

142
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,789
and said that she's going

143
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:40,550
to come get me tomorrow.

144
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:41,270
That I have to pack

145
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,050
my stuff up and I

146
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:43,729
don't know what I'm going

147
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:44,090
to do.

148
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:45,889
Right.

149
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,889
So, she kind of...

150
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:51,009
Played on your soft hearts

151
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:52,530
and said, can I come

152
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:52,870
stay there?

153
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,530
She never said, can I

154
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,050
come stay?

155
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:56,710
Just to be honest about

156
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,569
it, I'm the one who

157
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:58,930
said, hey, you know, this

158
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,629
is a bunch of crap.

159
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,430
Why don't we just go?

160
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,250
You know, she can stay

161
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:01,569
with us.

162
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:02,289
Okay, okay.

163
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,530
I'm the one that said

164
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:03,729
that.

165
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,159
As far as Bonnie, you've

166
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,479
never had a conversation with

167
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:10,800
that woman.

168
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,979
And you've never been face

169
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:15,860
to face with that woman.

170
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,060
You know where she lives,

171
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,600
but you've never, other than

172
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,420
you've driven by there.

173
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,000
Like two times, right?

174
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:24,360
Yes, that's correct.

175
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:25,199
And you've never been in

176
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:25,660
her vehicle.

177
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:26,040
Yeah.

178
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,279
And you've never had occasion

179
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,420
to handle her vehicle or

180
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:28,959
touch her vehicle.

181
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,560
That's correct.

182
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,120
But there's one little detail

183
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,300
investigators have been deliberately coy

184
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,959
about when talking to Roger

185
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:36,379
Carroll.

186
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,040
So finally, I was at

187
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,819
the end of the interview.

188
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,879
I was like, how do

189
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,459
we explain it that your

190
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:42,639
fingerprints are all over her

191
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,399
driver's door?

192
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,279
He stumbled just a bit

193
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:45,720
and says,

194
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,470
They've not been framed.

195
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:50,370
I mean, no, there's no

196
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,870
way that my fingerprints are

197
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,670
on that car door.

198
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:53,829
Or my DNA is on

199
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:54,430
that car door.

200
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,370
There just is no way.

201
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,410
He's asking, like, my prints

202
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,089
aren't on that door.

203
00:04:58,209 --> 00:04:58,889
I'm like, well, yes, they

204
00:04:58,889 --> 00:04:59,110
are.

205
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,310
I don't see how.

206
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,610
There's no way my fingerprints

207
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,750
are all over the door

208
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,209
of that car.

209
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:03,649
They are.

210
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,269
So he denied it still.

211
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,930
And the interview terminated pretty

212
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,689
quick after that.

213
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,350
Not only were his fingerprints

214
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,629
found on her car,

215
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,810
but he denied ever having

216
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,089
met her or ever been

217
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:16,730
there and ever been in

218
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,329
that parking lot.

219
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,490
So what do you make

220
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:18,689
of that?

221
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,970
That he's lying.

222
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:22,399
There's a third interview with

223
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:22,680
Heather.

224
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,639
Heather stays firm during this

225
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,720
interview that she didn't have

226
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
anything to do with it.

227
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,740
Bonnie went missing around 2

228
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,379
to 3 o 'clock in

229
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:32,879
the afternoon.

230
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:35,720
And his prints are on

231
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,920
Bonnie's truck.

232
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,110
What do you think?

233
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,660
I never wanted that to

234
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,579
happen to Bonnie.

235
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,399
I mean, sometimes I, you

236
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,660
know, she's mean, but I

237
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,779
wouldn't do that to her.

238
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,639
I didn't tell him to

239
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,279
touch Bonnie.

240
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,100
She was the only thing

241
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,639
I knew.

242
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,779
I wouldn't hurt her.

243
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,180
The police process.

244
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,600
Rogers graced at Anne.

245
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:02,699
But here's the thing.

246
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:04,240
They don't find any fibers

247
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,639
or DNA belonging to Bonnie

248
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,100
or even her fingerprints.

249
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:08,339
And they don't come up

250
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:09,079
with much of the Carroll

251
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,720
house either.

252
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,699
After the search in September,

253
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,120
there was really no evidence

254
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,860
found at the residence that

255
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,680
100 % put Bonnie there

256
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,139
at the Carroll property.

257
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:19,160
When you take somebody to

258
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,060
trial for first degree murder,

259
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,100
you better be right and

260
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,000
you better be ready because

261
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,079
you only get one shot.

262
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:27,540
We still didn't have Bonnie's

263
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,240
remains.

264
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,079
We didn't know if Bonnie

265
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,100
was alive or dead.

266
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:31,220
We didn't know if she

267
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:31,779
was dead at that time.

268
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,480
And what we did know

269
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,759
is that Roger Carroll was

270
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,060
lying.

271
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,959
Roger Carroll, based on the

272
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,839
lies that he told, was

273
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,959
charged with the offense of

274
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,300
obstruction.

275
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,720
Family members and friends felt

276
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,600
that he needed to be

277
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,279
charged with murder.

278
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,579
But based on it only

279
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,040
being a circumstantial case at

280
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,740
this point, that would have

281
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,060
been quite a stretch for

282
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,379
us.

283
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,279
So the case goes cold.

284
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:54,779
Your aunt is still missing.

285
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,220
What was that like for

286
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,699
your family?

287
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,160
I know that it was

288
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,139
very hard emotionally for many

289
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:01,639
family members.

290
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,160
It would take eight years

291
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,120
and one newly installed prosecutor

292
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,759
combing through a pile of

293
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,079
Madison County cold cases

294
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,300
And the first one you

295
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,720
stumbled on was Bonnie Woodward.

296
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,199
First one, Bonnie Woodward.

297
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,220
to breathe life back into

298
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,420
Bonnie Woodward's investigation.

299
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,379
Jennifer Mudge decides to try

300
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:21,259
to open a cold case,

301
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,600
but even before you can

302
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,740
relaunch anything, you get a

303
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,579
startling phone call.

304
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:27,860
We got a call from

305
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,740
Roger Carroll's neighbor and he's

306
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,180
asking me,

307
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,720
he's like, do you know

308
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,540
what's going on at the

309
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,060
Carroll's house?

310
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,069
I said, God, Roger, stop

311
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:35,550
it.

312
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,350
Just stop doing this.

313
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:38,870
Let me go.

314
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,050
Just let me go.

315
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,509
I'll do anything you want

316
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:41,990
me to do.

317
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:42,889
Just let me go.
