1
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,740
Roger Carroll pleads not guilty

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,919
to the murder of Bonnie

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,800
Woodward, but he's facing some

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,839
tall odds.

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:12,599
He may just not understand

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:13,619
how tall.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,859
One of the key pieces

8
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:17,179
of evidence turned out to

9
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:19,339
be a sassafras tree.

10
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:19,839
Yes.

11
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:22,260
Tell me how you decided

12
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,140
that you were going to

13
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,480
try to bring that into

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:24,940
the courtroom.

15
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,140
I'll be honest, we didn't

16
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,079
decide it. It was kind

17
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,780
of thrust upon us by

18
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,899
an investigator in Jersey County.

19
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,579
And all of us were

20
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:33,840
kind of like, yeah, go

21
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,539
ahead, whatever.

22
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,840
It isn't every day a

23
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,579
tree becomes a star witness

24
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:42,460
in a murder trial.

25
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:44,039
But this was never your

26
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,420
ordinary, everyday case.

27
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,039
So how would it factor

28
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:47,380
in?

29
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:48,880
Well, that and over a

30
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,679
hundred other key pieces of

31
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:52,500
evidence are finally being presented

32
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,100
in court.

33
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,759
Nearly a decade after Bonnie

34
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:56,740
Woodward went missing.

35
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:59,840
I thought everybody would give

36
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,619
up. I mean, I didn't

37
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:02,579
know what else to do.

38
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:04,239
And him being...

39
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,420
Being charged with Bonnie's murder

40
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,560
gave me life again.

41
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:10,260
And I thought, let's do

42
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:10,420
it.

43
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:14,569
The why question is very

44
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:15,890
difficult in this case because

45
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,069
there's not a clear -cut

46
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:18,010
motive.

47
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:19,790
Given what you were up

48
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,689
against, the fact that you

49
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:21,409
didn't have a body, you

50
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:23,010
didn't really have a motive,

51
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,030
you didn't have a weapon,

52
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:26,269
how confident were you that

53
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:27,049
you could get a guilty

54
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:27,349
verdict?

55
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,290
My partner and I said

56
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,590
this is just never going

57
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,969
to get any better.

58
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,569
We have everything we're ever

59
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:35,849
going to get, so we

60
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:36,629
thought we'd swing the bat.

61
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:39,819
In my years as a

62
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:41,579
prosecutor, I did five cases

63
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:42,900
where the victim's body wasn't

64
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,319
found, and it's a gamble.

65
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,140
So sometimes what you'll do

66
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,459
in lieu of that is

67
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:48,500
you have the person declared

68
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,099
dead.

69
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,359
It can, depending on the

70
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,040
case, really help the jury.

71
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,459
We took note that now

72
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:56,700
had been eight years that

73
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,739
Bonnie had not been seen.

74
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,040
So one of the first

75
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,959
steps we had to take

76
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,260
was to have Bonnie officially

77
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,340
declared deceased and were able

78
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,500
to obtain a death certificate

79
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,340
based on the circumstantial evidence

80
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,080
that she had not been

81
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,419
seen.

82
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:13,969
My name is Jennifer Schock,

83
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,150
and I was juror number

84
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,509
two.

85
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,349
What had you heard about

86
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:17,789
the case?

87
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:19,509
I hadn't. I truly came

88
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:21,430
in there not knowing anything

89
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,930
prior.

90
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:24,610
And when you realized how

91
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,710
big a case you were

92
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,539
deliberating on, what was your

93
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:29,800
reaction?

94
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,719
A little nervous to have

95
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,860
that much pressure put on

96
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,759
me to basically decide somebody's

97
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,159
future.

98
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,580
In opening statements, the prosecution

99
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,439
detailed what they say happened

100
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,379
during Bonnie's kidnapping,

101
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,240
including the fact that Roger

102
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,900
Carroll's fingerprints were found on

103
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,360
her car.

104
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,240
They also brought in Roger

105
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,659
Carroll's suicide attempt.

106
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,900
The jury must decide if

107
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,520
Roger is guilty of first

108
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,060
-degree murder.

109
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,219
The earlier charges against him

110
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:57,680
and Monica for harboring a

111
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,780
runaway, Heather, would be dismissed.

112
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,180
The defense opened up by

113
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,780
vowing to poke holes in

114
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,080
the state's case, particularly taking

115
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,479
aim at the son, Nathan

116
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:07,800
Carroll,

117
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,719
telling the jury his story

118
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,919
changed only after being granted

119
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:12,400
immunity.

120
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,379
Or what they called a

121
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:15,000
golden ticket.

122
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:17,419
Nathan was on the stand

123
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:18,060
for a good two to

124
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,400
three hours, maybe more.

125
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,139
I mean, just like in

126
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:22,180
the grand jury, you could

127
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,060
hear a pin drop in

128
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,639
that courtroom while he's testifying.

129
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,740
Because family secrets are spilling

130
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,960
out in this courtroom.

131
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,300
I mean, he's telling a

132
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,840
cold, hard, disgusting story that

133
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,479
clearly there was no doubt

134
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,020
that was truthful.

135
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,240
Nathan testifies that he heard

136
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,039
gunshots and told the jury

137
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,099
in gruesome detail

138
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:43,240
how he helped her.

139
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,259
And how he helped his

140
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:45,319
father burn Bonnie's body.

141
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,729
I think Nathan realizes that

142
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,349
his dad tried to kill

143
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:51,289
his mom, and that's just

144
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:52,090
crossing the line.

145
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:53,849
If you think about Nathan,

146
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:55,689
he is a young child.

147
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:57,860
And he's being controlled by

148
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,039
dad, and he witnesses something

149
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,800
horrific.

150
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,300
The son, Nathan, testifies.

151
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,460
And I'm told that it

152
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,780
was a very stirring, powerful

153
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,740
testimony.

154
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:09,860
What do you remember of

155
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:09,960
it?

156
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,259
I remember that after Nathan

157
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:12,939
testified,

158
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:13,979
I remember that after Nathan

159
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:13,979
testified,

160
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:14,879
it was completely silent.

161
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,560
It was just a silence

162
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,779
through the whole entire courtroom

163
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,199
afterwards.

164
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,240
It was just a silence

165
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,240
through the whole entire courtroom

166
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,240
afterwards.

167
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,399
Nathan's testimony doesn't really make

168
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:23,779
sense.

169
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:24,040
Nathan's testimony doesn't really make

170
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,040
sense.

171
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,579
Nathan keeps saying he's reluctant,

172
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:26,500
he did it anyway.

173
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,939
Why would Nathan help his

174
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:29,600
father do it?

175
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:29,800
Why would Nathan help his

176
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:29,800
father do it?

177
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,959
What's in it for him?

178
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,420
It's a big mystery.

179
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,779
Nathan can be hard to

180
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:35,060
read.

181
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,180
He was ashamed.

182
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:38,879
He knew what he had

183
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,720
done was wrong.

184
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,720
He knew what his father

185
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,600
had done was wrong.

186
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,459
And he knew that helping

187
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:45,560
clean up was wrong.

188
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:46,949
And he knew that helping

189
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:46,949
clean up was wrong.

190
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:47,730
He was very remorseful.

191
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,240
A lot of the trial

192
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,060
was built around corroborating what

193
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,019
he was telling us was

194
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:53,379
the truth.

195
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,019
We didn't want the jury

196
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:56,019
to just have to take

197
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:57,420
Nathan's word for it.

198
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:57,579
We didn't want the jury

199
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:57,579
to just have to take

200
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:57,579
Nathan's word for it.

201
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:58,660
We wanted to show that

202
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,139
it fit and matched all

203
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:01,399
the forensic evidence in this

204
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:01,660
case.

205
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:04,129
But the defense just keeps

206
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:05,550
chipping away at that evidence,

207
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:08,250
including those 27 bone fragments

208
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,050
that were found on the

209
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:09,430
property.

210
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,050
including those 27 bone fragments

211
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:12,649
that were found on the

212
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:13,009
property.

213
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,110
Bones were found, but they're

214
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:16,889
not the bones of the

215
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:17,170
deceased.

216
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,910
Bones were found, but they're

217
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:17,910
not the bones of the

218
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:17,910
deceased.

219
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,110
We were never actually able

220
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,689
to find DNA of Bonnie

221
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:22,129
Woodward on these bone fragments.

222
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:23,269
We were never actually able

223
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:23,269
to find DNA of Bonnie

224
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:23,269
Woodward on these bone fragments.

225
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:23,790
We were able to say

226
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,709
that these were bone fragments

227
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:26,689
believed to be of human

228
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:27,129
origin,

229
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:27,529
We were able to say

230
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:27,529
that these were bone fragments

231
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:27,529
believed to be of human

232
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:27,529
origin,

233
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:28,709
but we could not definitively

234
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:30,430
say that they were Bonnie

235
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,110
Woodward's.

236
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:31,310
but we could not definitively

237
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:31,310
say that they were Bonnie

238
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:31,310
Woodward's.

239
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:33,160
In fact, it's not clear

240
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,240
if they're human bones or

241
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,000
animal bones,

242
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:35,160
In fact, it's not clear

243
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,160
if they're human bones or

244
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,160
animal bones,

245
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,839
or whether they're bones that

246
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,079
were from an Indian burial

247
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,100
many years ago.

248
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,850
Prosecutors argued that the bones

249
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,310
were degraded by the fire,

250
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:44,589
Prosecutors argued that the bones

251
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:44,589
were degraded by the fire,

252
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:46,490
which Nathan described that burned

253
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,370
Bonnie's body.

254
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,759
And to prove that there

255
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,220
actually was a fire on

256
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:53,660
the property,

257
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:55,839
the prosecution used an unexpected

258
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,199
method and witness.

259
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,540
Nathan identified the burn spot

260
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,720
on this ridge behind the

261
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:00,980
house.

262
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:01,199
Nathan identified the burn spot

263
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:01,199
on this ridge behind the

264
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:01,199
house.

265
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,600
And where the burn spot

266
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,319
was is a sassafras tree.

267
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,509
The sassafras tree has a

268
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:09,089
scarred spot on the bark

269
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:10,430
several feet up the tree.

270
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:10,709
The sassafras tree has a

271
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:10,709
scarred spot on the bark

272
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:10,709
several feet up the tree.

273
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,680
The sassafras tree has a

274
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,180
scarred spot on the bark

275
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,459
several feet up the tree.

276
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:15,240
The sassafras tree has a

277
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,980
scarred spot on the bark

278
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,019
several feet up the tree.
