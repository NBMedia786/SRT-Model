1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,160
Going into its third day,

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,919
a baffling mystery is unfolding

3
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:10,980
in Alton, Illinois, a river

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,419
town outside St. Louis.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,619
Nurses' aide and mom of

6
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:17,100
four, Bonnie Woodward, vanishes in

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,800
broad daylight just before her

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,699
48th birthday.

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,109
Alton, it's a nice little

10
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:24,949
town. It's situated on the

11
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:26,190
Mississippi River and the Illinois

12
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:26,530
River.

13
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,910
It has a vibrant downtown,

14
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:31,010
a lot of history, and

15
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,570
it's a great place to

16
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,329
live and work.

17
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:36,070
So, with no sign of

18
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,109
Bonnie anywhere, her family goes

19
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:39,250
to the media, her older

20
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,109
brother tearfully pleading with the

21
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:41,429
public.

22
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,810
I want my sister. Somebody

23
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,289
please call us and let

24
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:46,490
us know what's going on.

25
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:47,869
We don't know nothing.

26
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,429
Nobody wanted this case solved

27
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:50,390
more than her siblings.

28
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,850
Whoever has my sister, please

29
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,670
let her go.

30
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,049
Bonnie's sister, Rebecca, and her

31
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:01,109
niece, Rachel, don't hesitate to

32
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,170
join in on the efforts,

33
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,170
making the 700 -mile ride

34
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:04,170
a success.

35
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,310
They'll drive to Alton from

36
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,109
their home in Louisiana.

37
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:08,090
Why were you concerned enough

38
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:08,730
to get in the car

39
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,370
and start driving?

40
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,870
Well, because she wouldn't just

41
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:11,629
not come home.

42
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:12,890
I just remember having a

43
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:13,810
stack of flyers and going

44
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,010
around and putting them on

45
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,030
every telephone pole that I

46
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,170
could.

47
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,810
The police naturally talked to

48
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:21,629
the people that had last

49
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:22,150
seen Bonnie.

50
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:23,049
Can I get your last

51
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:23,269
name?

52
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,090
Bosley B .A .U .S.

53
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,069
I know why.

54
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,950
Wanda Bosley was one of

55
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,150
the co -workers that worked

56
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,609
with Bonnie at the Eunice

57
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:32,430
Smith Nursing Home.

58
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,629
We have to find out

59
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:34,930
how Bonnie was during the

60
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:35,189
day.

61
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,650
Was she acting appropriate? Was

62
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,030
she, you know, upset about

63
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,349
anything?

64
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,299
Okay, and so you went

65
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,260
into this meeting. She was

66
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:43,739
in the meeting.

67
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,879
You got out around 3

68
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,819
o 'clock, and you, what

69
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:48,879
happened then?

70
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:51,340
So, well, at first, like,

71
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,579
in the meeting, I just

72
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:53,140
want to say,

73
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,819
Bonnie's, when she talked, she's

74
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:57,859
loud, and she seemed different

75
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:58,299
to me.

76
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,239
She was quiet, and her

77
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,980
voice was more mellow like

78
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,659
mine now.

79
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,140
And I remember thinking, man,

80
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,760
Bonnie seems a little different.

81
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,479
After that staff meeting, Wanda

82
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,520
says she headed to the

83
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,599
back parking lot to get

84
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,280
into her car.

85
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,500
Out of the corner of

86
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,039
her eye, she spots Bonnie.

87
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:17,159
And she's not alone.

88
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,780
She was standing, like, say

89
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,740
if this is the back

90
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,500
of her truck.

91
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,400
The guy was standing here,

92
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,099
and I was looking, and

93
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:28,780
Bonnie had walked up the

94
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,979
side of her truck to

95
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:31,159
the driver's door.

96
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,580
And the guy was just

97
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,280
standing there.

98
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,300
I didn't see anything strange,

99
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,020
but it...

100
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,099
Kind of seemed strange, because

101
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,599
I guess I had never

102
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,740
seen the man before.

103
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:42,180
Can you describe the guy

104
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,599
for me?

105
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,319
He was a white male.

106
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,360
He looked like he wasn't

107
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,979
very tall, maybe 5 '8",

108
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:50,259
5 '9", or so.

109
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,139
He was, like, a medium

110
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,020
-sized guy.

111
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,740
His hair was a salt

112
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,939
and pepper, more grayer than

113
00:02:58,939 --> 00:02:59,580
black.

114
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:02,539
Turns out, Wanda is not

115
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:03,719
the only co -worker to

116
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,360
have witnessed this strange sighting.

117
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,460
Several people report to police

118
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,300
seeing this mystery man, sitting

119
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,319
in a gray or silver

120
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,939
sedan, similar to a Chevy

121
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:13,740
Malibu, waiting for Bonnie to

122
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,479
get out of her staff

123
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:14,800
meeting.

124
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,180
So, the gray Chevy Malibu

125
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,360
was directly to the right

126
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,000
of her vehicle.

127
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,580
Plenty of people saw him.

128
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,419
Yeah, after the meeting, people

129
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:24,939
would see her interacting with

130
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:27,060
him outside both vehicles, and

131
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,280
ultimately got into the car

132
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,659
with him.

133
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,990
She did get into the

134
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,310
car willingly, and it did

135
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,229
not appear that she was

136
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:36,469
forced or anything like that.

137
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,240
Vincent Altony, the public's help,

138
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,039
finding a missing woman, 48

139
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,280
-year -old Bonnie Woodward.

140
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:46,379
The information regarding the person

141
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:47,500
that people had seen on

142
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,379
that parking lot was crucial.

143
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,539
She reportedly was seen talking

144
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:52,719
to someone inside a gray

145
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,939
or silver Chevy Malibu.

146
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,039
So, talking to the family

147
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,599
and friends, did anybody, like

148
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,080
a past relationship, match the

149
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,400
description?

150
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,259
And you don't know anybody

151
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:03,759
off the top of your

152
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,199
head that would have a

153
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,060
silver Malibu?

154
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:07,240
Her ex -boyfriend, Chester, Nick

155
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,639
Adams.

156
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,879
Chester's dad has a 2009

157
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,560
Impala.

158
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,800
If you put an Impala

159
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,520
and a Malibu side by

160
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,919
side, there's just a little

161
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,560
bit of difference.

162
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,480
It'd be hard to tell

163
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:17,839
the difference.

164
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,139
That's true.

165
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,379
Who does this guy sound

166
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:19,959
like to you?

167
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,180
Chester McAdams.

168
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,360
That's the only guy I

169
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,879
can figure out that fits

170
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,579
the description that it's Chester.

171
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,279
I mean, I don't like

172
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,360
to pinpoint a guy out,

173
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,199
but Chester fits every description.

174
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,779
And like the silver Impala,

175
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,180
his dad has a silver

176
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:35,579
Impala.

177
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,459
Do you know that for

178
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:37,680
sure?

179
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,100
Yeah, because he used to

180
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,560
date my mom.

181
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,399
Chester McAdams.

182
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,879
Chester McAdams piques the detective's

183
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,180
interest not only because he

184
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,500
dated Bonnie for a year,

185
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,579
but he also has an

186
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,759
extensive criminal record.

187
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:51,459
Bonnie started to see him,

188
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,420
and then I showed back

189
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,000
up in the picture and

190
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,879
ran him off.

191
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,500
Me and Bonnie's been together

192
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,899
probably seven or more years.

193
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,800
We parted about a little

194
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,079
over two years, and that's

195
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:05,699
when she got with that

196
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:06,220
Chester guy.

197
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,660
You and Chester ever have

198
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:07,959
words?

199
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:09,040
Oh, big time.

200
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,100
Big time hate each other?

201
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:10,800
Oh, yeah.

202
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:11,439
Fist fights?

203
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,439
I ran into him at

204
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,279
the bar. He was mad

205
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,120
because me and Bonnie got

206
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,759
back together.

207
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,360
So I kind of thought

208
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,180
maybe he was upset and

209
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,339
might have did something to

210
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:20,560
her.

211
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,360
And, sir, for the record,

212
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,000
I just need your last

213
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,279
name.

214
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,399
I'm McAdams.

215
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,639
Capital M, small c, capital

216
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,639
A, D -A -M -S.

217
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:29,860
And your first, sir?

218
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:30,740
Chester.

219
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,019
With Chester, it was a

220
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:33,779
very rocky relationship that Bonnie

221
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:34,560
had with him.

222
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,879
We'd break up, she'd kick

223
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:36,660
me out, and I'd be

224
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,399
gone for a week or

225
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,220
so, and then I'd be

226
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:38,920
moving back in.

227
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,680
Yeah, I've been down that

228
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:39,939
road.

229
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,240
Okay, so then, you know,

230
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:42,279
that would be two or

231
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,300
three months, and then I'd

232
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,540
be kicked out again, and

233
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,509
then back and forth.

234
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,970
And then about two months

235
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,189
before Gary got out, she

236
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:52,209
kicked me out, and then

237
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:53,810
next thing I know, Gary's

238
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,209
living there.

239
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,269
The family largely was saying,

240
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,370
hey, you guys need to

241
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,350
look at Chester McAdams.

242
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,170
When we found Chester McAdams,

243
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,569
he's got a beard, he's

244
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,089
got a ponytail.

245
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,639
Chester clearly doesn't match the

246
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,000
description of the man coworkers

247
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,839
saw days earlier in the

248
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,819
parking lot with Bonnie.

249
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,779
But what about that tip

250
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,300
from Bonnie's daughter, Jennifer, who

251
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,519
said Chester's father drives a

252
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,740
silver Chevy Impala?

253
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:20,689
Detectives want to talk it

254
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:22,029
over with father and son.

255
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,110
Do you ever drive his

256
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,610
truck or Impala, anything like

257
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:25,730
that?

258
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,069
No.

259
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:26,810
Do you ever allow him

260
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,629
to borrow it for any

261
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:27,990
reason?

262
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,250
No.

263
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,250
I would never ask my

264
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,129
dad to borrow his vehicle.

265
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:31,490
He'd say no.

266
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:32,310
Well, I know I'd say

267
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,329
no right off the bat,

268
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:33,550
John.

269
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:33,829
Right.

270
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,069
Don't even bother asking.

271
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:36,149
Don't even bother asking.

272
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,069
Well, I mean, we're investigating

273
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:38,910
this missing bird.

274
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:39,329
Right.

275
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,930
It could be more than

276
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:41,269
missing.

277
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:41,689
I mean, look at it.

278
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:42,290
It could have a big

279
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:42,730
problem.

280
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,110
Yes.

281
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,589
And it could be nothing.

282
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:45,709
It could be nothing.

283
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:45,970
Right.

284
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:47,110
I mean, I hope it's

285
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,269
nothing.

286
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,829
Chester McAdams was willing and

287
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:50,910
cooperative with us.

288
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:52,790
Ultimately, did not have direct

289
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,209
access to a vehicle that

290
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:55,189
was like that.

291
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,850
And also, we checked in

292
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,230
with his employer and they

293
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,430
confirmed that he was at

294
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,709
work.

295
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:01,569
So, that was a dead

296
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:02,230
end for us.

297
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,269
The family of a missing

298
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:06,750
Alton woman is now offering

299
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,750
a $5 ,000 reward to

300
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,410
anyone who can find her.

301
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,389
You have crime in this

302
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:14,470
area, but you don't have

303
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,610
missing adults too often.

304
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,689
We have people that run

305
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:19,329
away, but they're always found.

306
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,569
But this one, she just

307
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:21,790
fell off the face of

308
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,089
the earth.

309
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,459
We need to find my

310
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:24,779
sister.

311
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:26,060
We're running out of time.

312
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,980
Everybody knows the first three

313
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,240
days is critical.

314
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,579
With both Gary and Bonnie's

315
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:33,819
ex cleared, detectives are hitting

316
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:35,060
walls left and right.

317
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,060
But they're about to be

318
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,600
floored by some information that

319
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,699
reveals a disturbing coincidence in

320
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:41,420
the Woodward family.

321
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,709
Turns out, Bonnie wasn't the

322
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:44,990
only missing person in that

323
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,430
household.

324
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,329
Correct.

325
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:48,529
I need my daddy.
