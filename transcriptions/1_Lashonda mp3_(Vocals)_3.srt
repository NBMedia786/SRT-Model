1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,570
So they got that. I

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,310
understand that. But now we

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,029
got to talk about why

4
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:09,410
we're here.

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:10,289
Exactly.

6
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:12,710
So what's going through your

7
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,609
mind then when you're driving

8
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:16,089
by these boys' houses? Tell

9
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:16,670
me about that.

10
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,769
The only thing that's going

11
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:19,769
through my mind is, they're

12
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,489
like my son. I want

13
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,769
to know what happened to

14
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:24,609
my son, man.

15
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:25,070
Sure.

16
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,649
What happened to my son,

17
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,390
my brother?

18
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:31,170
Of those addresses, did you

19
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,329
ever get out and make

20
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:33,649
contact with anybody at any

21
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:34,250
of those addresses?

22
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:34,450
Addresses?

23
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,679
I get out. Yeah, I

24
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:39,679
get out. I knock on

25
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,039
the door.

26
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:42,340
Okay. Tell me how that

27
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:42,619
goes.

28
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,020
Sometimes I talk to the

29
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,960
little guys, and sometimes no

30
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,539
one answers.

31
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,719
Lately, it's been pitch black.

32
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,079
When I go down the

33
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,520
street, all the lights is

34
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:54,719
out.

35
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,000
So I'm saying in my

36
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,770
head, okay, I know. I

37
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,990
already know that you guys

38
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,829
had to do it to

39
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:00,909
him.

40
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,630
But you know what? I'm

41
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,350
not his mother.

42
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,680
I said, when I see

43
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,599
my son, I was going

44
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:06,599
to...

45
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,120
I'm going to press him

46
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,959
and make him do it.

47
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:10,379
Somebody is going to jail

48
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:13,510
for what they did to

49
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,010
him, man.

50
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,670
When you go by these

51
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,730
houses, were you alone, or

52
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,329
would you go with anybody?

53
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,670
It varies, because after it

54
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,269
happened to him, I go

55
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:26,670
by there every single day.

56
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,209
I stay right here on

57
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:30,049
the east side as well.

58
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,269
So I would frequently just

59
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:35,950
go by when I'm crying

60
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,510
or whatever.

61
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,609
I want those guys to

62
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:39,010
see my tears so they

63
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,069
can understand as well.

64
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:41,230
Man, this is a serious

65
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,010
matter, man.

66
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,489
What happened to the little

67
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:43,709
dude?

68
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:44,930
Man, you might be in

69
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,129
danger, right?

70
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:46,989
But I knew that they

71
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:47,810
wasn't in danger.

72
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:48,769
I knew that they did

73
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:49,310
that to him.

74
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,290
You're hurting.

75
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:51,859
Yes.

76
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,080
What do you drive? Is

77
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,680
it the car that you

78
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,300
got stopped in?

79
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,270
I got a blue Chrysler

80
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,669
300.

81
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:19,300
And what else do you

82
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:19,460
drive?

83
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:22,139
The white truck that I

84
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:22,680
was just in.

85
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:26,129
I drive that as well.

86
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,319
Either if I'm not in

87
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,639
the Chrysler, then I'm in...

88
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,840
The truck, because my girlfriend,

89
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,479
we...

90
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:47,919
It was a 9mm, and

91
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,699
he had, like, an extended

92
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:52,780
magazine on there.

93
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:55,189
Do you know what brand?

94
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,969
I don't know what brand.

95
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,129
Now, the reason I know

96
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:01,430
that is because me and

97
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,349
my mother is in the

98
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:02,610
car,

99
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,289
and just like I just

100
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:06,750
picking her up from work

101
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,090
and stuff,

102
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:09,710
and we left work, and

103
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,310
we're just driving down Payne,

104
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:12,129
and I see my son.

105
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:13,979
And I tell him, get

106
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:14,400
in the car.

107
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,879
Hey, boy, you eat today?

108
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,960
Because I'm not in his

109
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,280
household.

110
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,879
But it's like my little

111
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,120
brother as well as my

112
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,439
son.

113
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,500
So he gets in the

114
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,639
car, and I can tell.

115
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:25,979
I see it on him.

116
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,830
And I just grabbed it.

117
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,289
And me and my mother

118
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:33,270
was talking, and she was

119
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,030
kind of mad at me.

120
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:34,949
But I said, hey, man,

121
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:36,610
look, I don't know what

122
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,719
type of lifestyle you into,

123
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,039
right?

124
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,319
I'm not going to take

125
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,389
it from you because I

126
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,650
don't know if you need

127
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:43,909
it.

128
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:46,840
If I would have...

129
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:46,900
If I would have took

130
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,879
it, my son wouldn't have

131
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,199
been shot.

132
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,800
So that's hurting you.

133
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,780
That definitely hurts me.

134
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,319
Did you ever carry a

135
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:09,419
gun?

136
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:11,400
I've had it, yeah.

137
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,319
Okay.

138
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,159
Have you carried a gun

139
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,080
since this happened to your

140
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,300
son?

141
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,000
No.

142
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:16,620
You'll see what I got.

143
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,420
It's a knife in the

144
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:18,680
truck.

145
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,060
No guns for me, man.

146
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,199
That's what I say, man.

147
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,220
Look, man, just from implicating

148
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,509
me, it get bad for

149
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:32,209
me, right?

150
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:33,750
That's what I was trying

151
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,389
to tell.

152
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,930
The little guys, I haven't

153
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,389
seen those guys since they

154
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:41,110
told my kid's mother that

155
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,569
stuff, right?

156
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,769
About you being involved and

157
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:45,569
that lady getting hurt.

158
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,069
Exactly.

159
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:49,120
Now, before that, they will

160
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,980
see me.

161
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,839
So after they told her,

162
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,399
they never see me again.

163
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,459
Made me think you guys

164
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:59,160
really think about me.

165
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:26,279
You said geranium, the address

166
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,399
where the lady got hurt.

167
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,139
You said geranium.

168
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,699
Was that Cook?

169
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,660
The street?

170
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,990
Yeah.

171
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,610
I drive everywhere.

172
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:37,009
The kid's house is on

173
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:37,790
Cook, yes.

174
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,069
Where your son got shot?

175
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,129
Yes, that's where my son

176
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:42,550
got shot.

177
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,990
Okay.

178
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:43,850
Is that one of the

179
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,089
addresses that you drive by?

180
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:45,529
Yes.

181
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,009
It is.

182
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:46,310
Okay.

183
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,250
When she got hurt, right,

184
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:48,970
and I'm just going to

185
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,790
keep it real with you,

186
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:50,769
she wasn't just

187
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:51,029
hurt.

188
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:52,329
She was killed.

189
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,009
I know.

190
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,449
I heard that.

191
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:54,470
You know that.

192
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,389
That's why, yeah.

193
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:56,449
How long did it take

194
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:57,490
before you found out about

195
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:57,790
that?

196
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,910
The next day.

197
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:08,139
So when was the last

198
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:08,519
time?

199
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,579
Before that lady got killed,

200
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,740
that you were on that

201
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,139
block, that you drove by

202
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,100
that house?

203
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:16,879
I'm not sure.

204
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,980
I drove by a lot,

205
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:19,899
all the time.

206
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,019
Were you on that street?

207
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
Were you on Cook the

208
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,139
night that she was killed?

209
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,699
I was not, but I

210
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:27,579
did go through there that

211
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:27,819
day.

212
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,720
That day?

213
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:29,279
Yeah.

214
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:29,899
Do you have any idea

215
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:30,600
what time it was?

216
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,360
I got receipts from Dollar

217
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,720
General.

218
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,040
Me and my girlfriend went

219
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,459
to the store.

220
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,800
Remember if the sun was

221
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,560
up or the sun was

222
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:37,819
down?

223
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:40,480
Okay.

224
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,019
In that general bathroom?

225
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,639
Dollar is the name of

226
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:42,699
it.

227
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,660
I'm familiar with it.

228
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:44,860
That's the store that's right

229
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,079
next to the house where

230
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:46,759
she was killed?

231
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,120
Yeah.

232
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:47,560
Okay.

233
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:48,839
So you and your girlfriend

234
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,079
were there and purchased some

235
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:50,399
things?

236
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,399
Yeah.

237
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,500
I ride around in a

238
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,660
circle and a loop.

239
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:55,079
Okay.

240
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,439
The whole little basketball team

241
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,899
that my son used to

242
00:06:58,899 --> 00:06:59,939
be with, I just ride

243
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:02,319
just to see what

244
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,579
they're going to do to

245
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:03,800
me.

246
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,459
See, because if they did

247
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,579
something to my son, then

248
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:07,379
they're going to shoot me

249
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:07,860
too, right?

250
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:08,480
Okay.

251
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,379
That's all I've been doing.

252
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,160
And you're driving?

253
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,199
No, I'm talking about -

254
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:11,399
Are you using?

255
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,899
I'm talking about being alert.

256
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,540
Okay.

257
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,439
If I got to go,

258
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,360
I'm going to go right

259
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,000
then, but I think my

260
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,720
knife will do damage.

261
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:20,509
It's a nice knife, but

262
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,569
hey, it is what it

263
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:22,930
is, man.

264
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,439
The city's got cameras.

265
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,500
Go up any block and

266
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,319
you're going to see cameras

267
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,420
on doorbells.

268
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,000
You're going to see them

269
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,779
on eaves of houses and

270
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:48,379
everything else.

271
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,819
We can see you that

272
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:52,389
night driving around, just like

273
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,639
you're saying, big loop.

274
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,949
You didn't see me driving

275
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:57,230
around.

276
00:07:58,189 --> 00:07:59,389
Who else is driving that

277
00:07:59,389 --> 00:07:59,610
car?

278
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,639
Me or my girlfriend.

279
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:03,560
Mm -hmm.

280
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:05,170
All right.

281
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,730
I'm going to keep it

282
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,170
real with you.

283
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:07,709
There's cameras right on cook.

284
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,519
Okay?

285
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,100
Okay.

286
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,060
Two of the cameras that

287
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,139
are on cook, you'll have

288
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:13,259
an opportunity to see this

289
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,500
and read about

290
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,420
it, but two of the

291
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,459
cameras on cook, they've got

292
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:17,399
audio as well.

293
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,100
All right?

294
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,579
And as your truck drives

295
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:22,730
by, a couple of seconds

296
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,970
later, we start hearing the

297
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,529
horn honking,

298
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,579
and then we hear a

299
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:28,560
door, and then we hear

300
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,000
a shot.

301
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:29,850
Okay?

302
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:31,029
Okay.

303
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,809
And then we see your

304
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:33,610
truck pull out.

305
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,070
Okay.

306
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,210
On to Payne Avenue from

307
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,860
a nice little camera at

308
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,519
the pizzeria.

309
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,220
Okay.

310
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:42,399
Help me understand that.

311
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,019
No, I don't get it.

312
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:46,139
I don't get what you're

313
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:47,039
trying to tell me to

314
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,860
understand to you.
