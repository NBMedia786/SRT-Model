1
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:15,650
I'm trying to, I'm trying

2
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,949
to tell, I'm telling you

3
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,989
exactly what we're seeing, and

4
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:20,149
I'm asking you to explain

5
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:20,489
that.

6
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:22,480
Okay, you've told us that

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,920
you drive in circles, you

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,980
go around to these different

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,760
young boys' houses, and you

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,600
tell me that you haunt

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,760
the horn and everything else.

12
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:29,480
You tell me that you

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,460
and your girlfriend are the

14
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,620
only ones that drive that

15
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:31,940
vehicle.

16
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,079
Yeah, I talk, yeah.

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,399
Okay.

18
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:34,840
Yes, sir.

19
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:36,420
I'm telling you exactly what

20
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,640
we're seeing. I'm asking for

21
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,840
an explanation. I'm trying to

22
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,179
understand.

23
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:43,420
Okay. I don't know when

24
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,880
you're actually talking about.

25
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,579
I'm talking about the night

26
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:47,619
Ms. Nix was killed.

27
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,179
Like I said, it's been

28
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:50,619
so much s*** that's been

29
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:52,679
going on, and I ride

30
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,259
by those kids' house numerous,

31
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,200
right, on a day, every

32
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,899
day, right?

33
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,859
So, I don't know. I'm

34
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,200
not, I can't give you

35
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,189
an answer to that because

36
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:06,709
I'm not sure, right?

37
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,230
Okay.

38
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:09,090
When I'm there, when I

39
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,049
ride around and stuff.

40
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:11,090
These little places, like I

41
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,150
said, I don't know what's

42
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,129
be going on, what's going

43
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:14,969
to happen, or anything.

44
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,239
So, I just be riding.

45
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:18,359
Blowing.

46
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,920
Everybody knows it's JJ Dad.

47
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,459
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

48
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:22,900
hey, hey.

49
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,439
Hey, this is the little

50
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:26,599
boy.

51
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,739
That's it.

52
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,739
I don't know about anything

53
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:30,239
else.

54
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,120
I don't know about no

55
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,420
shots.

56
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:32,579
I don't know about no

57
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:32,939
murders.

58
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,939
No anything in that nature,

59
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:35,500
my brother.

60
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:52,739
I know.

61
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,359
I was getting the shots.

62
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,480
That down response as well,

63
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,120
I was like, you know,

64
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,040
the way that you guys

65
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,879
are looking at me, and

66
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,659
the way that you're acting

67
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:03,760
towards me, and make me

68
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,420
shut down.

69
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,840
This is the deal.

70
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,080
Your emotions that you had

71
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,759
when you came in here,

72
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:09,439
those are real.

73
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,840
You're hurting for your son.

74
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:11,379
I'm hurting.

75
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:12,500
Your son's s*** right now.

76
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:13,240
He's still hurting.

77
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,620
My son just got out

78
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,419
of the hospital yesterday.

79
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,520
And he's still got a

80
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,280
long road of recovery.

81
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,520
It's going to take some

82
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:18,780
time.

83
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,650
But what we're telling you,

84
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:23,229
I believe that too.

85
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,439
And there's some stuff in

86
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,419
your story that has been

87
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:26,740
accurate.

88
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:27,860
That has been truthful.

89
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:29,180
About you driving by.

90
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,539
We have several videos of

91
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:31,159
you driving by.

92
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,560
Which has verified that, just

93
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,039
like you said.

94
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,060
And we believe that.

95
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:35,919
You were there, in front

96
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,919
of that house, at the

97
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:37,860
time that shooting happened.

98
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,199
Doing the doot doot doot

99
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:39,979
with your horn too.

100
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:41,699
So that's why my partner's

101
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:42,800
asking you to explain it.

102
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,259
You get one opportunity to

103
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:44,919
tell your side of the

104
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,020
story of what happened.

105
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,099
But you were there in

106
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:47,879
front of that house at

107
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,620
that time of the shooting.

108
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,039
Not just me.

109
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,879
It was other people there

110
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,099
too.

111
00:02:52,780 --> 00:03:06,319
Alright, but you also have

112
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:06,800
to understand.

113
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,939
Put yourself, let's switch roles

114
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:09,500
here, right?

115
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,419
Put yourself on this side

116
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:10,680
of the table.

117
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,520
I did, I did.

118
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:12,560
I know, that's why I

119
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:12,759
asked.

120
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,879
I know, I know, I

121
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,039
know.

122
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,219
I know it looks bad,

123
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:17,000
but...

124
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,120
You were pissed off.

125
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,780
I can't corroborate what you

126
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,639
guys are saying.

127
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:21,759
You were pissed off.

128
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,780
You were angry that this

129
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,060
was happening.

130
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,199
I didn't f***ing do nothing.

131
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:28,969
Come on, man.

132
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,270
Man, I didn't do nothing,

133
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:31,569
man.

134
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,110
I'm telling you that.

135
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,289
You didn't hear a shot.

136
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,490
I'm seriously telling you.

137
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:36,830
You didn't hear a shot.

138
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,750
I didn't do anything.

139
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:39,729
I want to do something

140
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:40,610
to the little boy.

141
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:41,830
That harmed my son.

142
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:42,669
Did you mean to do

143
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:43,349
it to him and you

144
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,069
hit her accidentally?

145
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,210
No, ma 'am.

146
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:49,840
No, ma 'am.

147
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,199
No, ma 'am.

148
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:53,620
Mr. Johnson, the look of

149
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,680
surprise on your face.

150
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,639
You gotta be kidding me.

151
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:56,340
You're a smart guy.

152
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,590
You hear the words that

153
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,189
are coming out of your

154
00:03:59,189 --> 00:03:59,490
mouth?

155
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:00,770
You're putting yourself on the

156
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,810
block, right?

157
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,069
Honking the horn at the

158
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:03,909
time of this thing.

159
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,210
And you're telling us you

160
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:05,930
didn't hear a shot.

161
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:08,360
Are you on something?

162
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,689
Are you a drinker?

163
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:11,430
Do you use any drugs?

164
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:13,069
I mean, is there an

165
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,069
explanation for this?

166
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,870
Help us understand this.

167
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:17,610
That's all this is.

168
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,589
I mean, help us understand

169
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:18,910
it.

170
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:24,389
The understanding is I didn't

171
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,430
touch anybody, mommy.

172
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:27,050
I didn't touch anybody.

173
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,899
I didn't see.

174
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:30,480
Yeah, we didn't see you

175
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,060
touch somebody.

176
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,160
I did not touch anybody.

177
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,459
I did not do anything.

178
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,019
I didn't shoot any guns.

179
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,500
You'll catch a knife in

180
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:37,939
my car.

181
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,199
I don't have any guns.

182
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,620
At all.

183
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:42,800
I'm trying to be as

184
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,819
honest as straight up.

185
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,480
As front.

186
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,339
You aren't to a portion

187
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:46,019
and then you stop.

188
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,759
Would you guys?

189
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,220
Is that true?

190
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,279
Because I.

191
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,600
This is your chance to

192
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,259
get it off of you.

193
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,980
You have to understand these

194
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,959
kids recognize you.

195
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,139
They know who you are

196
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:55,839
just like you know who

197
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,160
they are.

198
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,060
Yes, I know.

199
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,740
They've been with me.

200
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,759
So they've seen you as

201
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,740
you left out of there.

202
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,779
They've been with me for

203
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:02,100
eight years plus.

204
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:02,699
Okay.

205
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,300
So these kids like the

206
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,259
little other J .J. kid,

207
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:05,980
he would know who you

208
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,160
are.

209
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:06,680
Or the other.

210
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:07,139
Yes.

211
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,319
The kids that live there.

212
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:09,300
All of them.

213
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,019
You don't think that they

214
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,160
didn't see you leave from

215
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,620
there after their mom was

216
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:12,860
shot?

217
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,560
Miss Lady.

218
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,079
Killed on the ground right

219
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:15,660
in front of them?

220
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,139
And her grandbaby?

221
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,079
I didn't kill nobody, man.

222
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:24,329
I didn't kill nobody.

223
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,269
I tell you that.

224
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:33,220
Tell us what happened, Mr.

225
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:33,519
Johnson.

226
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:36,350
That's what happened, sir.

227
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:37,930
You haven't really told us

228
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,149
anything.

229
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,060
What do you mean that's

230
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,399
what happened?

231
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,240
That's what I did.

232
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,579
What did you do?

233
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,980
I just drove around.

234
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,259
Just drove around?

235
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,959
I just drove around, man.

236
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,920
In your mind's eye.

237
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,139
Give me your mind's eye

238
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:52,620
for me.

239
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,259
Get on cook like you're

240
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:55,279
driving up to the street.

241
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,240
You're driving up to the

242
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,519
house.

243
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,300
Right?

244
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,360
Tell me what you're seeing.

245
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,259
Tell me what you're hearing.

246
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:00,000
Tell me what happens.

247
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:03,029
Nothing.

248
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:03,649
No.

249
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,870
Nothing at all.

250
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:05,550
Okay.

251
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:07,189
I can't believe that.

252
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:07,930
Just based...

253
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:08,589
It was just you and

254
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:09,089
I talking.

255
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:10,050
Right?

256
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:10,810
And I didn't have these

257
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,509
other things.

258
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,189
You wasn't afforded this video

259
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:14,930
with audio.

260
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,389
You wasn't going to believe

261
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:16,910
me anyways.

262
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,449
Are you sure?

263
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,269
Positive.

264
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:18,910
Positive.

265
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:19,490
You gave me...

266
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,529
If I understood.

267
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:21,810
Right?

268
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,750
If I understood from you.

269
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,730
But you're not telling me

270
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:24,970
anything.

271
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:25,610
You're just telling me you

272
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,170
drove by.

273
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:27,629
You were there honking the

274
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:28,069
horn, whatever.

275
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:28,930
But you didn't...

276
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,170
You didn't hear a gunshot.

277
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,829
You would never understand.

278
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:33,310
Try me.

279
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,310
I did what you would

280
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:35,610
do.

281
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:36,230
Okay.

282
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,930
And you guys put me

283
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,610
over here and interrogate me

284
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,550
and try to give me

285
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,290
a story that you make

286
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,290
up for me.

287
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:47,569
When I told you what

288
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:50,110
happened, I told you about

289
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,769
my son being like that.

290
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,310
Right?

291
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:54,649
You did.

292
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,069
You guys ain't...

293
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:58,420
Sorry.

294
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,240
I'm sorry.

295
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,819
I'm sorry.

296
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,600
And I am.

297
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,839
And I truly mean that.

298
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:05,779
I'm a father myself.

299
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,399
It's not active.

300
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:08,300
How do you know?

301
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:09,120
Because I know.

302
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,740
Because I see the little

303
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,620
dude on Facebook showing my

304
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,139
son gun.

305
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:14,480
He said...

306
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,579
And he said...

307
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,740
That's what I mean.

308
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:17,339
It's not active.

309
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,199
Have you talked to an

310
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:18,540
investigator?

311
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,519
Little dude's face.

312
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:20,660
Have you talked to an

313
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:20,980
investigator?

314
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:22,040
No, ma 'am.

315
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,259
So before you say that

316
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,339
it's inactive, you need to

317
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:25,040
get the facts on it.

318
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,519
And that's the thing.

319
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,740
I'm not putting it in

320
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,579
making a story yet.

321
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,579
I'm basing it on the

322
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:29,680
facts that I've been spending

323
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,759
for the last week and

324
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,519
me and my partner have.

325
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,040
On facts that we've gathered

326
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,600
in evidence to put you

327
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,240
in this spot.

328
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,439
We didn't put you in

329
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:36,600
here.

330
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,579
We didn't just go pick

331
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:38,379
you up just randomly.

332
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,180
It's based on evidence that

333
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,579
we've gathered and it's facts.

334
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,079
Okay.

335
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,800
Straight facts.

336
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,259
Okay?

337
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,319
It's not...

338
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,180
I'm just in.

339
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,139
I'm trying to understand what

340
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:49,379
happened.

341
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,319
Because what I'm looking at,

342
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,399
I think I know what

343
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:54,699
happened.

344
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,420
Okay?

345
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,459
I'm pretty sure I do.

346
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,920
And you keep telling me

347
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,220
that I...

348
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,240
If you knew what happened,

349
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,439
you would go and get

350
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:00,660
the...

351
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,839
Look at that dude instead

352
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,040
of having me down here.

353
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:03,480
Really?

354
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,439
That's what you would do.

355
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,000
Really?

356
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:05,759
Yeah.

357
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,560
Who did it then?

358
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,379
Because the fact is, my

359
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:09,379
son is shot in the

360
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:09,680
face.

361
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,459
Nobody's down.

362
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:13,750
I'm down here.

363
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,339
I wasn't actually...

364
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:16,560
Whoa.

365
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Did you have an alibi

366
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,139
or...

367
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:19,060
No, anything.

368
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,620
I'm just automatically guilty because

369
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,579
you seen my car.

370
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,180
I didn't even...

371
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,480
I didn't even do anything.

372
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,560
I didn't even do anything.

373
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,589
And then...

374
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:47,460
I'm seriously telling you.

375
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:48,799
I did not do anything.

376
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,700
I want to do something

377
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,019
to the little boy that

378
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:52,820
harmed my son.

379
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,620
Did you mean to do

380
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,340
it to him and you

381
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,019
hit her accidentally?

382
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:58,200
No, ma 'am.

383
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:00,809
No, ma 'am.

384
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,169
No, ma 'am.

385
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,590
Mr. Johnson, the look of

386
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,649
surprise on your face.

387
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,389
You got to be kidding

388
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,610
me.

389
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:07,330
You're a smart guy.

390
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:09,570
You have the words that

391
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,149
are coming out of your

392
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:10,450
mouth.

393
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:11,750
You're putting yourself on the

394
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,789
block, right?

395
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:14,049
Honking the horn at the

396
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:14,889
time of this thing.

397
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:16,190
And you're telling us you

398
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,889
didn't hear a shot.

399
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:18,409
You have to understand these

400
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:19,409
kids recognize you.

401
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,570
They know who you are

402
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,289
just like you know who

403
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:21,590
they are.

404
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,490
Yes, I know.

405
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,549
They've been with me for...

406
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:24,190
So they've seen you as

407
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,169
you left out of there.

408
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:26,230
They've been with me for

409
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,549
eight years plus.

410
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:28,129
Okay.

411
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,710
So these kids like the

412
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,669
little other J .J. kid,

413
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,409
he would know who you

414
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:32,710
are or the other kids

415
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,750
that live there.

416
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:34,730
All of them.

417
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:35,450
You don't think that they

418
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,590
didn't see you leave from

419
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,049
there after their mom was

420
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:38,289
shot?

421
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:39,009
Miss Lady.

422
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,509
Killed on the ground right

423
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:41,110
in front of them?

424
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:42,549
And her grandbaby?

425
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,509
I didn't kill nobody, man.

426
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:50,090
I didn't kill nobody, I

427
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:50,690
tell you that.

428
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:51,529
That's...

429
00:09:51,529 --> 00:10:05,299
I did what you would

430
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:06,200
do, okay?

431
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:06,460
Okay.

432
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,820
You guys put me over

433
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,700
here and interrogate me and

434
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,740
try to give me a

435
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,580
story that you make up

436
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,299
for me.

437
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,559
When I told you what

438
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:20,120
happened, I told you about

439
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,759
my son being like that,

440
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,279
right?

441
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,559
You did.

442
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,080
You guys ain't...

443
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:28,639
Start over.

444
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:32,559
I'm basing it on the

445
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,659
facts that I've been spending

446
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:34,720
for the last week and

447
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,519
me and my partner have.

448
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,019
On facts that we've gathered

449
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,580
in evidence to put you

450
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,220
in this spot.

451
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:40,399
We didn't put you in

452
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:40,559
here.

453
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,539
We didn't just go pick

454
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:42,399
you up just randomly.

455
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,139
It's based on evidence that

456
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:45,580
we've gathered and it's facts.

457
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:47,090
Okay.

458
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,210
Straight facts, okay?

459
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,269
It's not...

460
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:51,019
I understand.

461
00:10:51,360 --> 00:11:16,259
Mr. Johnson, you got upset

462
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,340
with us when we told

463
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,559
you about the evidence that

464
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,139
we do have

465
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:20,519
and I just asked you

466
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,259
to simply just to explain,

467
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,120
to try to explain and

468
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,980
help us understand how we

469
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,779
got it wrong.

470
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,759
You know what I mean?

471
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:30,059
Can you help us?

472
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:31,259
Because we're not there.

473
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,539
I was going to say,

474
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,460
yay, you didn't get it

475
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:34,980
wrong, man.

476
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,139
You got to do what

477
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:36,919
you have to do because

478
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,659
that's your job.

479
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,919
I'm going to ask you,

480
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,059
these clothes and stuff, you

481
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:48,080
still have those clothes?

482
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,330
That ain't me.

483
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,450
That's not you?

484
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:52,909
No.
