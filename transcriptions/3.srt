1
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:18,929
Bonnie Woodward's disappearance is the

2
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:20,109
talk of the small town

3
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:21,629
in Illinois she called home.

4
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:23,269
Bonnie Woodward has been missing.

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,629
Friends and family were gathering

6
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:25,870
to pray for her return.

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,050
We need you to find

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,469
my sister. We're running out

9
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:28,789
of time.

10
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:31,710
Investigators are frustrated and increasingly

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,350
concerned.

12
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:34,770
We were doing missing person

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,509
flyers, talking to local media.

14
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:38,030
We were trying to push

15
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,350
this out there as much

16
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,789
as we can.

17
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:41,270
Maybe somebody saw her somewhere

18
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,310
at a bus station, at

19
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,469
a train station, in a

20
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:44,310
cab, at the mall.

21
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,289
We're trying to get any

22
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:46,270
kind of lead that'll take

23
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:46,890
us where we need to

24
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,090
go.

25
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:48,310
But they're all kind of

26
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,149
wild goose chases.

27
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:50,909
It's as if she's vanished

28
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:51,689
into thin air.

29
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:53,829
Right. It wasn't without leads.

30
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,950
Somebody would say they saw

31
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,509
somebody similar in Pontoon Beach,

32
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,090
Applebee's in Kansas City.

33
00:00:58,369 --> 00:00:59,789
But none of them appeared

34
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:00,850
to have much merit.

35
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,789
We had to expand our

36
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,750
investigation and look into everything

37
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,950
about her life that was

38
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,870
going on at that time.

39
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,069
You discover, wait, she's not

40
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:12,409
the only missing person in

41
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:12,969
that household.

42
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:14,209
Right. Right.

43
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,650
It turns out that her...

44
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,549
stepdaughter, Heather Woodward, had been

45
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,109
reported missing to the East

46
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:20,870
Alton Police Department more than

47
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,709
a week before.

48
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:24,069
East Alton Police Department, which

49
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:25,049
is a separate police department

50
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:25,569
from ours.

51
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:26,969
So we were not aware

52
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:27,769
of that at the time

53
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:28,689
that Bonnie went missing.

54
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,409
It was nothing 100 %

55
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:31,370
that told us that the

56
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:31,969
two were linked.

57
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,489
So at that point, we're

58
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:34,870
having to do a dual

59
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,370
investigation.

60
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,480
This is a huge coincidence

61
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,000
in a small town that

62
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,939
a mother and stepdaughter go

63
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:43,959
missing in the same house.

64
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,219
Huge. Huge.

65
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:50,269
Remember, Heather Woodward is Bonnie's

66
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:51,769
17 -year -old stepdaughter.

67
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,579
Bonnie adopted Heather and her

68
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:56,299
brother Aaron after their dad

69
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:57,780
passed away when Heather was

70
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,260
just eight.

71
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,219
After Bonnie adopted them, it

72
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:02,500
was made very abundantly clear

73
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,959
they're in the family.

74
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,930
Those are her kids.

75
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,349
The house is a busy

76
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:11,129
one with Bonnie's adult daughter,

77
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:12,629
Jennifer, and her two little

78
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:12,990
girls.

79
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,169
Plus Heather, Aaron, and boyfriend,

80
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,729
Gary, all living under one

81
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:17,129
roof.

82
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,610
And the family tells...

83
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,650
For the detectives, there was

84
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,669
friction between Heather and Bonnie.

85
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,020
It was an unhappy teenager,

86
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:26,099
and it was a stepmom

87
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,699
giving her chores to do,

88
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,879
and there was a little

89
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,240
resistance.

90
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:30,819
At some point, they argue,

91
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,620
and Heather wants to move

92
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,199
out, and Bonnie initially doesn't

93
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,060
resist the idea.

94
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,659
Our investigation revealed that around

95
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:43,020
June 10th, Heather went with

96
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,400
her teacher, and that was

97
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,599
Christine Sheffel, and Bonnie knew

98
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,539
about this.

99
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,879
That teacher pictured in the

100
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,159
high school yearbook along with

101
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:52,439
Heather.

102
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,219
Heather moved in with her

103
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:55,819
just two weeks before Bonnie

104
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:56,340
vanished.

105
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:58,680
And now that both Bonnie

106
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,919
and Heather are missing, investigators

107
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,379
have lots of questions.

108
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,979
I'm here with Christine Sheffel.

109
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:08,419
I wanted to get the

110
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,340
history of how she became

111
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,860
engaged with Heather's life.

112
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,020
And then the number one

113
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,259
question is, where is she

114
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:14,479
now?

115
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,120
She was last with you.

116
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,139
Where is she at?

117
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,879
I have Heather now for

118
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,960
one class as a freshman

119
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,819
for the entire year.

120
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:23,099
She has been very vocal.

121
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,479
Both Sue, myself, and all

122
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,800
the other teachers of the

123
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,780
abuse that goes on at

124
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,000
home.

125
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,639
Things like being slapped or

126
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,080
thrown against a wall, or

127
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,680
woke up at 3 in

128
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,620
the morning to wash every

129
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,439
dish in the house.

130
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,560
Just plain crazy stuff.

131
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:39,159
And who's the one she's

132
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,500
watching that does all this?

133
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:40,819
Bonnie.

134
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,949
We knew that East Alton

135
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:45,830
Police Department was aware of

136
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,449
these reports, and we could

137
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:49,069
not get anything to substantiate

138
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:49,530
these reports.

139
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,330
Heather painted a picture of

140
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,469
your aunt.

141
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:54,909
And she was seen as

142
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:55,750
being abusive.

143
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:57,610
What do you make of

144
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,469
those allegations of abuse?

145
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:00,710
I can't see it.

146
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,849
I can see her being

147
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:05,189
loud with anybody, child or

148
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:06,889
not, and just being vocal,

149
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:09,219
but not abusive.

150
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,419
There was no way.

151
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,699
Heather has been telling everyone

152
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,139
for over a year that

153
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:15,319
when she turns 18, she

154
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,040
will be kicked out.

155
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,480
She called and said that

156
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,399
I'm getting kicked out and

157
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:18,980
I need you to come

158
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,339
get me.

159
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,819
The teachers, I believe her

160
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:21,519
heart was in the right

161
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,800
place as she's trying to

162
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,899
help this 17 -year -old.

163
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:25,019
Yeah.

164
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:25,500
Child.

165
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,060
Bonnie called us and wanted

166
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,819
Heather back.

167
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:30,100
So, and I did tell

168
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,759
her she had to go

169
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,240
back home.

170
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,500
So, she cried most of

171
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:33,759
the night.

172
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:35,160
And then whenever you came

173
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,459
back on the 17th, she

174
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:36,980
was gone.

175
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:37,639
Right.

176
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,019
So now, according to this

177
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,819
teacher, Heather leaves her home

178
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:43,860
on the 17th.

179
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:45,879
That same day, Bonnie reports

180
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,100
Heather as a runaway.

181
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,079
Bonnie went knocking on doors.

182
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,180
It was driving Bonnie nuts

183
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,500
because she couldn't find her.

184
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,899
In obtaining the reports.

185
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,720
It was clear that Bonnie

186
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,240
wanted to find her stepdaughter.

187
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,480
And she was not getting

188
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,019
the information she wanted from

189
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:06,560
the teacher.

190
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,980
And she was adamant that

191
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,079
no matter what, she was

192
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:10,800
going to find her.

193
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,399
And now, detectives aren't making

194
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,839
much headway in finding Heather

195
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,279
either.

196
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,240
The teacher who Heather had

197
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,519
been living with says she

198
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,899
has no idea where Heather

199
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:22,500
might have gone.

200
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,100
There was nothing that we

201
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,860
could really prove that she

202
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,379
knew where Heather was.

203
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,259
But clearly, I'm still skeptical.

204
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:30,879
Are they telling the whole

205
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,180
truth?

206
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,610
With her lack of intent

207
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,050
on trying to find Heather,

208
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:41,470
and if she was that

209
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,089
much of a mentor to

210
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:43,290
her,

211
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:45,250
why wasn't she more concerned

212
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,490
about Heather's whereabouts if she

213
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:47,930
didn't know?

214
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,019
Heather's teacher's interview only raises

215
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:10,639
more questions for investigators.

216
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,300
Are these disappearances linked?

217
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,899
And if so, how?

218
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:18,329
As investigators, you're fairly convinced

219
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:20,730
that she might have had

220
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,350
something to do with the

221
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:22,709
disappearance,

222
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:23,949
or at the very least,

223
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:25,009
know something.

224
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,389
We think the two events

225
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:27,370
have to be linked in

226
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:27,769
some way.

227
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,269
Two missing persons from the

228
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:30,750
same house, one a juvenile,

229
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:30,750
and the other a child.

230
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,230
One a juvenile and one

231
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,509
adult, like, you almost have

232
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:35,310
to believe they're related.

233
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,990
Like, it's really naive to

234
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,509
think they're not.

235
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,089
After almost a week and

236
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:40,689
no sign of Bonnie, her

237
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:42,370
family's anguish turns pointed,

238
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:44,089
lashing out at that mystery

239
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:45,310
man from the parking lot.

240
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:47,029
You let my sister go,

241
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:48,550
and I'll come and get

242
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,850
her. I want my sister.

243
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:51,810
I felt like Heather had

244
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,910
the answers that we needed.

245
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:53,970
We believed she was the

246
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:54,949
key to finding Bonnie.

247
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,660
And that's when police get

248
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,259
a game -changing phone call

249
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:01,360
from a nearby library.

250
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,959
I had heard it over

251
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,980
the sleep scanners. It was

252
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,579
very strange.

253
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:05,879
It seems someone showed up

254
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,120
there with a teddy bear

255
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,660
and a story to tell.

256
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,829
I had to pee, Mr.

257
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,250
Bear.
