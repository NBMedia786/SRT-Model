1
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:06,339
Investigators are drilling down on

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,019
the Carroll family,

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:08,160
and the story of what

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,500
they think might have happened

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,019
to Bonnie Woodward is beginning

6
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:11,839
to take shape.

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,779
Monica, she's not present. She's

8
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:16,679
not a co -defendant on

9
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:17,039
the incident.

10
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,399
I honestly do believe that

11
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,010
he did away with Bonnie

12
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:22,510
Woodward.

13
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,260
I don't know how, but

14
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:28,780
I don't know how.

15
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:32,789
We doubled down on the

16
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:34,969
theory that Nathan was likely

17
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,649
with Roger at the time

18
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:37,450
that Bonnie disappeared.

19
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,990
Nathan was 16 years old

20
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,770
at the time that this

21
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,149
crime was committed.

22
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,609
Nathan is now 24.

23
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,329
You're talking about a kid

24
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:50,090
versus an adult, so I

25
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,469
think maybe you focus on

26
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:51,770
him.

27
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,390
We made several attempts to

28
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,570
talk to Nathan, and he

29
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,609
refused to talk to law

30
00:00:58,609 --> 00:00:59,049
enforcement.

31
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:01,240
We served him with a

32
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,659
subpoena to come testify in

33
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:03,619
front of the grand jury.

34
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,239
I made a decision to

35
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,859
grant him immunity at the

36
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,219
time.

37
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:09,760
If he would tell us

38
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,219
the full truth, and then

39
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:14,159
fate sort of took over

40
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:14,540
from there.

41
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:17,750
What did he say that

42
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,730
tipped his hand to you

43
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:19,890
that he was about to

44
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,629
spill the whole truth?

45
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:21,870
He held up the immunity

46
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,049
paper and said, this is

47
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:23,930
good no matter what I

48
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,030
tell you, and I said

49
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,250
yes.

50
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,709
He put his hands on

51
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:31,329
the rail, and boy, that

52
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:32,450
testimony was gripping.

53
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:35,849
He broke down, and he

54
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:37,049
started crying, and he said

55
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:37,950
he was going to tell

56
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,370
us everything.

57
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,409
That's kind of a thing

58
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:41,370
maybe you see on TV

59
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,409
with people breaking down in

60
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:43,890
the courtroom and spilling the

61
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,670
beans in the courtroom, but

62
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,489
it really never happens, but

63
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:46,750
it did.

64
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,530
Sitting in the room was

65
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,870
12 grand jurors, myself and

66
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,689
Jennifer, and Nathan's attorney.

67
00:01:53,769 --> 00:01:55,530
It was absolute silence. You

68
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,450
could hear the clock tick.

69
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,099
It's like watching the weight

70
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:06,200
of the world being lifted

71
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,299
off this young man's shoulders.

72
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:11,960
He told the entire story

73
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,580
about what happened that day.

74
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,680
He says that he's on

75
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,020
vacation.

76
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,680
With his whole family, they

77
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,900
have Heather there, and his

78
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,020
dad said to him the

79
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,280
night before, you and I

80
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,460
are leaving early tomorrow.

81
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,469
They drove to Eunice Smith

82
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:31,949
Nursing Home, and his dad

83
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:33,289
said, good, she's at work.

84
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:35,289
Then after they get home,

85
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,509
Roger changed clothes, clipped his

86
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:40,819
fingernails, he shaved, and retrieved

87
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:42,819
his Stoger 9mm from the

88
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:45,960
house, and left Nathan there

89
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,379
by himself.

90
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,889
He told Nathan he was

91
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:50,430
going to get Bonnie.

92
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,490
Nathan set up a tent

93
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,030
in the backyard.

94
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,560
The tent in the backyard

95
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,419
was essentially a death trap

96
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:59,780
to lure Bonnie to the

97
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,139
backyard and not into the

98
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:01,439
residence.

99
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,039
He's eating lunch. Next thing

100
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,460
he hears is eight or

101
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,280
nine gunshots, and they're close.

102
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,460
They're in his driveway.

103
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:12,159
He walks outside, and that's

104
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,979
when he sees feet with

105
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:16,439
tennis shoes on and tan

106
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,000
scrubs.

107
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,460
There are a few things

108
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,280
that stay with me.

109
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,460
Like, he remembers that he

110
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:22,620
was in a car accident.

111
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,439
He was eating leftover deli

112
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:26,960
meat sandwiches from Heather's graduation

113
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,560
party.

114
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,240
If you're making a story

115
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,949
up, you don't go that

116
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:31,949
detailed into what kind of

117
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:32,569
lunch you're having.

118
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,169
But the next detail may

119
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:36,349
be the most disturbing of

120
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:36,550
all.

121
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,629
Nathan tells the grand jury

122
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:39,710
that his dad had him

123
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,530
light a fire in the

124
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:40,870
backyard,

125
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:43,229
and testifies he watched as

126
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:44,629
his father loaded Bonnie's body

127
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:45,909
into a bucket loader,

128
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:47,229
a tractor with a scoop

129
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:47,949
on the front of it,

130
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,430
and bring her to that

131
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,949
burn pit.

132
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,669
And they start a massive

133
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:53,009
fire.

134
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,280
It had to be stoked.

135
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,780
All day, all night, every

136
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,500
couple of hours.

137
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,759
And Roger had Nathan help

138
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,240
him do that.

139
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:04,860
When you heard the scope

140
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,960
of what he confessed to,

141
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,740
what went through your mind?

142
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:09,759
I don't think we thought

143
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,259
fire or burned on a

144
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:12,740
brush pile.

145
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,979
Talk about being haunted.

146
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,439
Right. Like, not only is

147
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,199
Roger creating a horrible thing

148
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,600
for him to live with,

149
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,720
it seems like he created

150
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,620
a horrible thing for his

151
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,259
son to live with.

152
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,939
After his grand jury testimony,

153
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,899
Nathan brings investigators back to

154
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:28,060
the house.

155
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,160
What you're about to see

156
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,839
is the actual video police

157
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,379
captured

158
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:33,819
as Nathan brings them back

159
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:34,860
to where he says the

160
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,600
crime took place,

161
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:37,819
a spot first identified eight

162
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,579
years earlier by cadaver dogs.

163
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,779
During our search in September

164
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:44,360
of 2010, we had 60

165
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,600
acres that we had to

166
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,060
worry about.

167
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,819
Now we have a few

168
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:49,360
hundred feet.

169
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,660
Nathan, you've agreed to just

170
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,459
walk us through a few

171
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,920
areas that are of interest

172
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,120
in our investigation involving your

173
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,480
father,

174
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,019
and the investigation of missing

175
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:00,040
person Bonnie Woodward.

176
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,949
Nathan points out the back

177
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:05,189
corner of the residence where

178
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:06,370
he found Bonnie's body

179
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,810
and saw her, where the

180
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,949
shot had come from.

181
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,610
This is where she laid.

182
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,829
I never saw the full

183
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:16,259
body. I was over there.

184
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:16,740
Okay.

185
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,519
And I saw feet.

186
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,399
It was in that site

187
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,920
that we did find a

188
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,240
nine millimeter cartridge,

189
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:25,019
which was significant because Nathan

190
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:26,879
had identified that Roger had

191
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,980
used a nine millimeter handgun.

192
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,740
Ultimately that day in shooting

193
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,180
Bonnie.

194
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:35,290
The second site that Nathan

195
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,490
took law enforcement to was

196
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,750
what we refer to as

197
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,490
the burn pit.

198
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:43,990
Followed by the creek where

199
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,449
Nathan says he saw his

200
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:47,209
dad dump Bonnie's ashes.

201
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:48,769
So we had a site

202
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:50,610
number three for where this

203
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,129
was dumped into the creek

204
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:52,350
bed.

205
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,290
Was that tractor with the

206
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,550
bucket end on it?

207
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:55,930
Correct.

208
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:57,970
Little pieces of white things,

209
00:05:58,029 --> 00:05:58,829
but I don't know exactly

210
00:05:58,829 --> 00:05:59,569
what it was.

211
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,329
They don't know any idea

212
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:01,750
what they were?

213
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,139
I guess it would be

214
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:07,060
bone, but I don't know.

215
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,040
Law enforcement were able to

216
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,060
find 27 pieces of what

217
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,100
they believed to be bone

218
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,500
fragment

219
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,240
that were collected and sent

220
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,100
off to the lab to

221
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,639
see if any DNA or

222
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,899
any connection could be made

223
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:20,360
to Bonnie.

224
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,879
All right, gentlemen. Thank you.

225
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,360
Based on the version of

226
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,399
events that Nathan gave,

227
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,480
we felt comfortable charging Roger

228
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,740
Carroll with first degree murder

229
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,540
of Bonnie Woodward.

230
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,199
A man linked in 2010

231
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,279
to the disappearance of Bonnie

232
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,660
Woodward today has been charged

233
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,540
with her murder.

234
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,500
I thought, wow.

235
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,699
I mean, they're actually charging

236
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:42,759
somebody for murder.

237
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,319
But not so fast.

238
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,980
Some critical evidence will be

239
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,319
unveiled in court which could

240
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,199
upend the case.

241
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:51,120
The DNA on those bone

242
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,600
fragments?

243
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,660
It's not what police expected.
