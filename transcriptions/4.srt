1
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,440
Summer is in full swing

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,759
here in Alton, Illinois. Backyard

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,720
barbecues, 4th of July fireworks.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,580
Bonnie Woodward used to host

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,939
these kinds of events, but

6
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:16,179
not this year. She's been

7
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:17,820
missing for a week. And

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,260
in a twist, her teenage

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,699
stepdaughter is missing too. Until

10
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:22,920
out of the blue, eight

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,059
days after Bonnie vanished, through

12
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,679
these doors walks the missing

13
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,480
teenager, Heather Woodward.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,640
The East Alton Police Department

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,640
received a call from the

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,460
library that there's a person

17
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,939
saying that she's Heather Woodward.

18
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,579
With all the speculation going

19
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,799
around, I wanted to hear

20
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,759
what she had to say.

21
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:43,679
They got Heather, took her

22
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,880
to the police station, and

23
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,240
I thought, man, they're going

24
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,399
to find out something now.

25
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,140
And would you state your

26
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:54,600
name, please?

27
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,659
Heather Woodward.

28
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:57,179
And your birthday, Heather?

29
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:57,759
Today.

30
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,219
Physical condition for Heather was

31
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:02,259
not of anything that was

32
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:02,820
of a concern.

33
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,099
There was no...

34
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,700
Injury to her. Clearly, she

35
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,099
had been being taken care

36
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:08,439
of.

37
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,920
Okay. What do you know

38
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,500
about the whole situation with

39
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,159
Bonnie and everything?

40
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,140
What I read in the

41
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:13,579
paper.

42
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:14,379
Okay.

43
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:14,760
That's it.

44
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,260
And I guess you read

45
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,260
in the paper that you

46
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:17,959
were also...

47
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:18,680
Yeah.

48
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,640
A little citizen running away

49
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:19,920
also?

50
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:21,719
And I was planning on

51
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,000
coming home on my birthday.

52
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:24,439
That was the plan, so

53
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,219
I didn't have to go

54
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,319
back to Bonnie's house.

55
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,480
I was taken back that

56
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,379
how can she be actually

57
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:31,480
18 years of age?

58
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:38,879
My mom claustrophobic moose, and

59
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,519
even my daddy.

60
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,780
But she's clutching a teddy

61
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,040
bear.

62
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,390
Yes.

63
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,579
July 3rd is her 18th

64
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,819
birthday, so she's a bona

65
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:54,640
fide adult in the state

66
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,200
of Illinois, but she talks

67
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,620
more like a...

68
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,560
Well, I don't want to

69
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,480
be insulting, but like a

70
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,659
grade school student or a

71
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:02,319
junior high student.

72
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,500
I need my books. I

73
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,759
need my books.

74
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:10,039
I need my books, books,

75
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,159
books, books, books.

76
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,069
She showed up at a

77
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:14,569
library. What did you think?

78
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,889
That it was absolute .

79
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:17,009
What do you mean by

80
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:17,169
that?

81
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,189
Like, why are you showing

82
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:19,849
up at a library? Who

83
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:22,439
brought you? Where did you

84
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,620
come from? Where have you

85
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:23,840
been?

86
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:25,620
Something doesn't smell right.

87
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,319
Pretty much.

88
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,580
What made the decision that

89
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,020
you would go to the

90
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,819
library? Why not to the

91
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:30,759
police department or something?

92
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,139
Because I always go to

93
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:34,159
the library. I walk there

94
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,620
all the time, and I

95
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,340
wasn't comfortable walking to the

96
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,060
police station.

97
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,400
Do you think you're in

98
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:39,800
any trouble?

99
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,520
I don't know.

100
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,159
I'm scared.

101
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,680
Yes, you had a lot

102
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,919
of people concerned about you.

103
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,860
We don't know what happened

104
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,919
to you. We don't know

105
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,680
what happened to Bonnie.

106
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:51,180
I haven't talked to my

107
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,479
mom.

108
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,039
Heather's thought of it was

109
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,360
it wasn't that big of

110
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,240
a deal that Bonnie had

111
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,860
disappeared.

112
00:02:58,139 --> 00:02:59,400
It didn't come across to

113
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,080
me that she had a

114
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,699
lot of concern about where

115
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,000
Bonnie was at the time.

116
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:04,479
What do you think happened

117
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:04,819
to her?

118
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:06,759
I don't know. I thought

119
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,379
that maybe she hid to

120
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:09,280
draw me out, and then

121
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,319
she'll come out now that

122
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,439
she knows that I'm home.

123
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,219
That's what she thought? Why

124
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:13,860
would she think that?

125
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,900
Because sometimes that's just the

126
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,719
way Bonnie is, and she

127
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,900
can be mean, and I

128
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:24,740
don't know. She's just mean.

129
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,599
You know, I gave her

130
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,199
the safe space to talk

131
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,379
to me about situations in

132
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:31,819
the home, and pretty much

133
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:32,699
the extent of it was

134
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:33,939
that she was being made

135
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,479
to do chores and clean

136
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:35,979
the house.

137
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,900
You know, typical things that

138
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,860
I think a lot of

139
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,099
teenagers and youths do.

140
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,479
And should be doing.

141
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,319
Because I'm not going back

142
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,560
there to be slave labor

143
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,479
and a free babysitter. I

144
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,599
just couldn't do it no

145
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:48,939
more.

146
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,539
From what she told multiple

147
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:53,020
people, she was being physically

148
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,280
and verbally and mentally abused.

149
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,639
You know, it doesn't go

150
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,139
beyond the realm of possibility

151
00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:59,840
that maybe she was embellishing

152
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,719
more about that relationship between

153
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,479
her and Bonnie.

154
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,560
To pull the heartstrings of

155
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,039
people that, you know, were

156
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,659
close to her. That could

157
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:09,319
be of assistance to her.

158
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,080
And one of those people...

159
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,000
Police begin to realize, may

160
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,699
have been that teacher, Christine

161
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:16,680
Scheffel, who took Heather in.

162
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:18,120
Ms. Scheffel has been there

163
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,540
for me for four years,

164
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,920
and she was afraid for

165
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,040
me to go home because

166
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,399
Bonnie can be mean, and

167
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,339
sometimes she hits.

168
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,819
There was an investigation into

169
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:32,060
Bonnie's parenting.

170
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah, it's DCFS, Department of

171
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,300
Children and Family Services, and

172
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,519
they had been involved before.

173
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:37,860
And what did they find?

174
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,920
It was unfounded.

175
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,759
There's no evidence of significant

176
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,079
abuse.

177
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,779
Do you think Heather was

178
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:45,399
manipulating adults into thinking that

179
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,959
her stepmother was evil?

180
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,160
I don't know if she

181
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,800
was intentionally manipulating adults, but

182
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,480
that was definitely what happened.

183
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:56,259
One thing's clear to investigators.

184
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,420
Heather was in someone else's

185
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,660
care in the two weeks

186
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,339
after she left that teacher's

187
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:03,300
house, during that critical time

188
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,560
when Bonnie went missing.

189
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:08,000
So now, of course, detectives

190
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,620
are curious, who was she

191
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:09,860
with?

192
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,560
And why is Heather protecting

193
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:11,879
them?

194
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:14,420
And then I went to

195
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,639
stay at a friend's house.

196
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,259
Okay, and who was that?

197
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:19,769
Just a friend.

198
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,790
I don't want to get

199
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,329
them in trouble.

200
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,870
So, just a friend.

201
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,790
They helped me, and they

202
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,470
knew the situation, so.

203
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,310
Well, you know, I have

204
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,069
to ask who it is.

205
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,029
She was very resistant to

206
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,910
talk at all about where

207
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,930
she had been, or what

208
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,730
she's been doing, and who

209
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:43,949
with.

210
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,569
They're not going to get

211
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:46,629
in trouble, are they?

212
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:48,089
Well, I don't know about

213
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:48,269
that.

214
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:49,810
They don't know nothing. They

215
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,889
don't like Bonnie.

216
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,870
I don't, I don't want

217
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,910
to know where Bonnie's at.

218
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:58,370
And as seasoned investigators, you

219
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,019
thought she's hiding something?

220
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:02,560
Yes, and we had to

221
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,459
push hard enough to get

222
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:04,019
that information.

223
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:05,879
They told me they didn't

224
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,360
know Bonnie was missing, and

225
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,860
I don't want to get

226
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,759
them in trouble.

227
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,000
Because it'll be all my

228
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,480
fault.

229
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,500
It didn't mean to cause

230
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,319
them trouble.

231
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:17,019
And I didn't know Bonnie

232
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:18,139
was going to go missing.

233
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,560
So now, another layer to

234
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,079
this mystery.

235
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,740
She was painting a pretty

236
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,579
ugly picture of her stepmother.

237
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,620
And might that have motivated

238
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,379
somebody to try to protect

239
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:30,720
her?

240
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,060
Sure.

241
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,019
Are they just good Samaritans,

242
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,319
or something else?

243
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,870
There's maybe more to this

244
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,189
than just taking care of

245
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,410
Heather.

246
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,790
The trail will lead detectives

247
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,850
down these winding roads into

248
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,649
truly uncharted territory.

249
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:48,129
We didn't see that coming

250
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:49,389
from a mile away.

251
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,579
Bonnie Woodward disappeared in Alton

252
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:03,259
June 25th at about 3

253
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:04,720
in the afternoon after getting

254
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,339
off work.

255
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,839
Her family members haven't seen

256
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,959
or heard from her since

257
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,579
that day.

258
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:13,500
Bonnie Woodward has been missing

259
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,420
for over a week.

260
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,290
Her boyfriend of seven years,

261
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:19,230
Gary Wilmerth, says he catches

262
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,790
glimpses of her in every

263
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,529
passing stranger.

264
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:23,529
There was times I could

265
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:25,430
be at a store, pass

266
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,689
somebody on the street.

267
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:28,230
Could be the color of

268
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,709
their hair.

269
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:31,399
I remember talking to her

270
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,259
grandbabies.

271
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,819
They said, are you going

272
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:36,720
to bring Grandma back?

273
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,420
You got a picture of

274
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,699
these little bitty girls looking

275
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:41,079
at me.

276
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,180
Where's Grandma?

277
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,529
I just thought in my

278
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:47,370
heart she was going to

279
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:47,889
come back.

280
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,290
And I wasn't taking no

281
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,009
for an answer.

282
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:54,990
She was coming back.
