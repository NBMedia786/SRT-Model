1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,330
Where did she go? Right

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,430
here? She goes right here.

3
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,230
She goes right here. He

4
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,240
gets her down. He gets

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,480
her down. She goes down.

6
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:11,480
And he just kind of

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,599
like straddles her. Emily's like

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,620
kicking around and everything. Squirming.

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,739
I mean, not actually like

10
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:19,179
fighting, fighting, but she's really

11
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:20,460
resisting trying to get out.

12
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,160
And she's squirming and she

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,420
kind of works herself where

14
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,010
she's kind of like wedged

15
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,969
inside of this doorway. And

16
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:29,350
he's just straddling, riding.

17
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:49,350
Riding. This is one of

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,530
those times where I just

19
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,079
wonder if I run over.

20
00:00:54,439 --> 00:01:01,469
It looked more like acting

21
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:47,909
than emotion. My personal opinion

22
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,150
and the opinion of family

23
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,540
is that Emily would have

24
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,459
kicked Vito's tail, even if

25
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:53,900
he had a gun.

26
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:56,079
I think it took both

27
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,579
of them to get her

28
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:59,439
corralled and get her taped

29
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,959
up because I think she

30
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,840
would have fought tooth and

31
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,060
nail.

32
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:04,969
Once I got the gun

33
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:06,590
away from you, I mean,

34
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,590
we're still locked up like

35
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,689
this. He has started to

36
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:11,629
grab me with that hand,

37
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,270
so you haven't got me

38
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,590
grabbed.

39
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,030
As he's trying to demonstrate

40
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,490
here how he got it

41
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,710
away from him, he just

42
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,430
can't make it work. And

43
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,569
he's kind of laughing.

44
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:31,210
I think he thinks, and

45
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,389
I've tried to show them

46
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:33,030
what happened.

47
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,229
And this isn't working. It

48
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:38,370
is a, I'm in trouble

49
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:38,770
after.

50
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:41,750
So we made a trip

51
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,180
to Waffle House. We're getting

52
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,699
the video ready.

53
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,199
And we found the date

54
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,300
and time roughly, and we

55
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,240
started looking and all of

56
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,920
a sudden we see these

57
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,980
people come walking through the

58
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,220
door.

59
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,680
And there's Ann. And there's

60
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,480
Ryan and there's Vito.

61
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,449
And they walked over to

62
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:05,290
a booth. That was on

63
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,870
the 21st of October.

64
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,830
And Ryan, in all of

65
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,789
his interviews so far,

66
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,129
said he had only met

67
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:45,289
Vito on the 23rd.

68
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,519
So he's obviously deliberately lied

69
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,980
to us about how long

70
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,000
he had known Vito.

71
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:53,559
Things were adding up. But

72
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,299
in order to arrest someone

73
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:56,740
on a felony offense, you

74
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,720
need probable cause.

75
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,399
In a perfect world, we

76
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,080
wanted a confession.

77
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,070
Have I done an okay

78
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,570
job? I'm not the best

79
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,379
explainer in the world. I

80
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:04,039
never have been.

81
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:05,620
Every time we talked to

82
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,500
him up to that point,

83
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,049
it was very casual, really

84
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:12,470
not questioning him on anything.

85
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:14,450
And this time, we wanted

86
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,149
to start kind of putting

87
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,029
pressure on him.

88
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,700
And looking at the case

89
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,820
out there, there's a lot

90
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,700
of things that have popped

91
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,460
up in our investigation that

92
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,220
we want to iron out.

93
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,879
Of course.

94
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,440
Alright. The whole gun thing.

95
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,120
First, you told me that

96
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,860
you went to the basement

97
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,360
and retrieved the gun. Because

98
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,240
we went over it. Could

99
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,820
you get it out of

100
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,019
the state?

101
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,159
I actually said that I

102
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:12,840
retrieved it.

103
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,080
Yes, you went down to

104
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,919
the basement to get it.

105
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,259
We talked about it for

106
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,120
a while. And then today,

107
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,039
you told me you brought

108
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:18,159
it.

109
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,379
The gun being in your

110
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,620
car versus downstairs in the

111
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,620
basement in your dad's gun

112
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,519
room, I'll call it?

113
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:15,980
Correct.

114
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,059
Okay. That's an inconsistency that

115
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:19,080
popped up today.

116
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,299
Correct. Well, the thing is,

117
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,519
I did a bad job

118
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,159
of explaining.

119
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,700
That's not a bad job

120
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,960
of explaining. It's totally the

121
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,299
opposite.

122
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,059
I thought, no, your communication

123
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,600
skills are fine. You just

124
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,179
happened to have killed your

125
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:34,559
family.

126
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:35,919
And you don't want to

127
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,759
tell us what happened.

128
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,340
Let's go on to the

129
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,220
next one. This one is

130
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,700
what I'm curious about.

131
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,299
Okay.

132
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:48,429
The duct tape. We've seen

133
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:49,730
it today on the reenactment.

134
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,480
Yeah. Bet y 'all could

135
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:51,879
get it.

136
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,259
Yeah. It wasn't that hard.

137
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,460
Yeah. And the thing is,

138
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,980
I suppose I could have

139
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,480
too, but it just wasn't,

140
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,269
I wasn't, I wasn't thinking

141
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,529
that.

142
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,190
Okay. You know, he's paying

143
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,169
a lot of attention to

144
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:05,710
your sister.

145
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:06,470
Mm -hmm.

146
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:08,450
And you could have just

147
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,629
ran out the side door.

148
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:09,929
Why?

149
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:10,509
Why didn't you do that

150
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:11,289
and go for help?

151
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:12,029
No way.

152
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:13,090
Why?

153
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:14,730
Well, my sister's there.

154
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:15,929
Did you love your sister?

155
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:16,529
Yes.

156
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:18,610
Did it cross your mind

157
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,370
at all you wanted to

158
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,470
just rip his head off

159
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,769
and piss down his throat

160
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:22,830
for doing that to your

161
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,110
sister?

162
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,669
Yes. And that's what made

163
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,919
it, that's what made that

164
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,600
so difficult.

165
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,690
But if I had run

166
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,830
at him from across the

167
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,399
room and failed, you know,

168
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,679
your cards played.

169
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:37,960
Why play your only card

170
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,200
when you can't be sure

171
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,740
it'll work?

172
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,340
Because if you don't, you're

173
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,220
probably going to die anyway.
