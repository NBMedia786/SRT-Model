1
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,620
So we got that. I

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,359
understand that. But now we

3
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:09,080
got to talk about why

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,460
we're here.

5
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:10,359
Exactly.

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,759
So what's going through your

7
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:13,900
mind when you're driving by

8
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,359
these boys' houses? Tell me

9
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:16,719
about that.

10
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,839
The only thing that's going

11
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,899
through my mind is, they're

12
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,530
like my son. I want

13
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,809
to know what happened to

14
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:24,649
my son, man.

15
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:25,129
Sure.

16
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,699
What happened to my son,

17
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,440
my brother?

18
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,219
Of those addresses, did you

19
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:32,399
ever get out and make

20
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,700
contact with anybody at any

21
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,299
of those addresses?

22
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:34,520
Addresses?

23
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,710
I get out. Yeah, I

24
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,729
get out. I knock on

25
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:40,090
the door.

26
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:42,390
Okay. Tell me how that

27
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:42,670
goes.

28
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,070
Sometimes I talk to the

29
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,009
little guys, and sometimes no

30
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:48,590
one answers.

31
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,750
Lately, it's been pitch black.

32
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:53,130
When I go down the

33
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,570
street, all the lights is

34
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:54,770
out.

35
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,049
So I'm saying in my

36
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:58,850
head, okay, I know. I

37
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,070
already know that you guys

38
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:00,890
had to do it to

39
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:00,950
him.

40
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,689
But you know what? I'm

41
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:03,409
not his mother.

42
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:05,750
I said, when I see

43
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,390
my son, I'm not his

44
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,390
mother.

45
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:06,989
I was going to press

46
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:07,790
him and make him do

47
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:08,030
it.

48
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,450
Somebody is going to jail

49
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,560
for what they did to

50
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,060
him, man.

51
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,700
When you go by these

52
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,760
houses, were you alone, or

53
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,379
would you go with anybody?

54
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,719
It varies, because after it

55
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,340
happened to him, I go

56
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,739
by there every single day.

57
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,280
I stay right here on

58
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,099
the east side as well.

59
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,319
So I would frequently just

60
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:36,000
go by when I'm crying

61
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,579
or whatever.

62
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,659
I want those guys to

63
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,060
see my tears so they

64
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,640
can understand.

65
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:40,780
Well, hey, man, this is

66
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,040
a serious matter, man.

67
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,540
What happened to the little

68
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:43,760
dude?

69
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:44,980
Man, you might be in

70
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,180
danger, right?

71
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,040
But I knew that they

72
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,859
wasn't in danger.

73
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:48,799
I knew that they did

74
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,359
that to him.

75
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,340
You're hurting.

76
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:51,909
Yes.

77
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,740
What do you drive?

78
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:11,620
Is it the car that

79
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,340
you got stopped in?

80
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:15,319
I got a blue Chrysler

81
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:15,719
300.

82
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:19,349
And what else do you

83
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:19,509
drive?

84
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,189
The white truck that I

85
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:22,729
was just in.

86
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,180
I drive that as well.

87
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:28,349
Either if I'm not in

88
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,990
the Chrysler,

89
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,069
I'm in the truck, because

90
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,569
my girlfriend, we...

91
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,949
It was a 9mm, and

92
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,759
he had, like, an extended

93
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,840
magazine on there.

94
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,259
Do you know what brand?

95
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't know what brand.

96
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,180
Now, the reason I know

97
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,500
that is because me and

98
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,400
my mother is in the

99
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,659
car,

100
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,360
and just like I just

101
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,800
picking her up from work

102
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,139
and stuff,

103
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,759
and we left work, and

104
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,379
we're just driving down Payne,

105
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:12,219
and I see my son.

106
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,180
I tell him, get in

107
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:14,460
the car.

108
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,879
Hey, where you eat today?

109
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,020
Because I'm not in his

110
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,319
household.

111
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:19,919
But it's like my little

112
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,180
brother as well as my

113
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,500
son.

114
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,569
So he gets in the

115
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:24,650
car, and I can tell.

116
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:26,030
I see it on him.

117
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:28,909
And I just grabbed it,

118
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:31,330
and me and my mother

119
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:31,830
was talking,

120
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:33,590
and she was kind of

121
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,090
mad at me.

122
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:35,009
But I said, hey, man,

123
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:36,669
look, I don't know what

124
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,770
type of lifestyle you into,

125
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:39,090
right?

126
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,370
I'm not going to take

127
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:40,930
it from you,

128
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,189
because I don't know if

129
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:43,949
you need it.

130
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,000
If I would have took

131
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,939
it, my son wouldn't have

132
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:48,259
been shot.

133
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,840
So that's hurting you.

134
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,819
That definitely hurts me.

135
00:03:52,219 --> 00:04:09,340
Did you ever carry a

136
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:09,479
gun?

137
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,360
I've had, yeah.

138
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,360
Okay.

139
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,219
Have you carried a gun

140
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,139
since this happened to your

141
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:14,360
son?

142
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:15,039
No.

143
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,680
You'll see what I got.

144
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,480
It's a knife in the

145
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:18,740
truck.

146
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,100
No guns for me, man.

147
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,259
That's what I say, man.

148
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:27,269
Look, man, just from implicating

149
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:27,709
me,

150
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,889
it get bad for me,

151
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,269
right?

152
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,970
That's what I was.

153
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,689
That's what I was trying

154
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:35,470
to tell the little guys.

155
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:36,790
I haven't seen those guys

156
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,750
since they told my kid's

157
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,610
mother that stuff, right?

158
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:44,810
About you being involved and

159
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,610
that lady getting hurt.

160
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:46,170
Exactly.

161
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,160
Now, before that, they will

162
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,019
see me.

163
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:51,899
So after they told her,

164
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,420
they never see me again.

165
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,490
Made me think you guys

166
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,230
really think about me.

167
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:26,339
You said geranium, the address

168
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:27,459
where the lady got hurt.

169
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,560
You said geranium, is that

170
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,689
Cooke, the street?

171
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,069
Yeah.

172
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,610
I drive everywhere.

173
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,029
The kid's house is on

174
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,850
Cooke, yes.

175
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,129
Where your son got shot?

176
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,189
Yes, that's where my son

177
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:42,589
got shot.

178
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,029
Okay.

179
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:43,870
And is that one of

180
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,870
the addresses that you drive

181
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,149
by?

182
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:45,689
Yes.

183
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,069
It is.

184
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:46,370
Okay.

185
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,290
When she got hurt, right,

186
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,050
and I'm just going to

187
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:49,850
keep it real with you,

188
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:51,329
she wasn't just hurt, she

189
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:52,370
was killed.

190
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:53,470
I know, I heard that.

191
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:53,529
She was dead.

192
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,509
You know that?

193
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,430
That's why, yeah.

194
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:56,509
How long did it take

195
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:57,550
before you found out about

196
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:57,829
that?

197
00:05:58,189 --> 00:05:59,009
The next day.

198
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:08,670
When was the last time

199
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,610
before that lady got killed

200
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,810
that you were on that

201
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,170
block,

202
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:13,730
that you drove by that

203
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,149
house?

204
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,939
I'm not sure.

205
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:19,040
I drove by a lot,

206
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:19,939
all the time.

207
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,069
Were you on that street?

208
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:23,170
Were you on Cooke the

209
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,189
night that she was killed?

210
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,750
I was not, but I

211
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,610
did go through there that

212
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:27,850
day.

213
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:28,769
That day?

214
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,329
Yes.

215
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:29,949
Do you have any idea

216
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:30,649
what time it was?

217
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,000
I got receipts from the

218
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,759
Dollar General.

219
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,100
Me and my girlfriend went

220
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,500
to the store.

221
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:35,899
Okay.

222
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:36,860
Remember if the sun was

223
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,639
up or the sun was

224
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:37,839
down?

225
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,040
Uh -huh.

226
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:40,509
Okay.

227
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,430
And the General Dollar is

228
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,170
the name of it, I'm

229
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,050
familiar with it, that's the

230
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,750
store, that's

231
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,569
right next to the house?

232
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:46,050
Yep.

233
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:46,810
Where she was killed?

234
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:47,250
Yep.

235
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:47,629
Okay.

236
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,910
So you and your girlfriend

237
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,129
were there and purchased some

238
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:50,449
things?

239
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,490
Yep.

240
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,550
I ride around in a

241
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,709
circle and a loop.

242
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:55,149
Okay.

243
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,509
The whole little basketball team

244
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:58,949
that my son used to

245
00:06:58,949 --> 00:06:59,990
be with, I just ride

246
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,370
just to see what

247
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,629
they're going to do to

248
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:03,850
me.

249
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:05,490
See because if they did

250
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,649
something to my son, then

251
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:07,430
they're going to shoot me

252
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,930
too, right?

253
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:08,550
Okay.

254
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,470
That's all I've been doing.

255
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:10,209
And you're driving?

256
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,829
No, I'm talking about, I'm

257
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:12,930
just talking about being alert.

258
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:13,610
Okay.

259
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:14,490
If I got to go,

260
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:15,410
I'm going to go right

261
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,050
then, but I think my

262
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,769
knife will do damage.

263
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,569
It's a nice knife, but

264
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:22,629
hey, it is what it

265
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,949
is, man.

266
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,459
The city's got cameras.

267
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,560
Go up any block and

268
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,379
you're going to see cameras

269
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:45,740
on doorbells, you're going to

270
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,240
see them on

271
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,040
eaves of houses and everything

272
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,459
else.

273
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:49,759
And we can see it

274
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,240
that night, driving around, just

275
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,720
like you're saying, big loop.

276
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,079
You didn't see me driving

277
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:57,220
around.

278
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,430
Who else is driving that

279
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,649
car?

280
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,680
Me or my girlfriend.

281
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,209
All right.

282
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:05,769
I'm going to keep it

283
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:06,209
real with you.

284
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,529
There's, there's cameras right on

285
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:07,750
cook.

286
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,560
Okay.

287
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:10,180
Okay.

288
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,120
Two of the cameras that

289
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,199
are on cook, you'll have

290
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,339
an opportunity to see this

291
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:14,579
and read about

292
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:14,839
it.

293
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,819
But two of the cameras

294
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:16,860
on cook, they've got audio

295
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,500
as well.

296
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:19,129
All right.

297
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:20,629
And as your truck drives

298
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:22,819
by, a couple of seconds

299
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:24,040
later, we started hearing the

300
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,579
horn honking.

301
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:26,639
And then we hear a

302
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:26,839
door.

303
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:28,709
And then we hear a

304
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:28,949
shot.

305
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:29,910
Okay.

306
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,069
Okay.

307
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:31,449
Okay.

308
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:32,330
Okay.

309
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:32,870
And then we see your

310
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,909
truck pull out onto Payne

311
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,399
Avenue from a nice little

312
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,559
camera at the pizzeria.

313
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:40,299
Okay.

314
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,440
Help me understand that.

315
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,419
I don't know.

316
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:45,039
I don't get it.

317
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,179
I don't get what you're

318
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:47,080
trying to tell me to

319
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,899
understand to you.

320
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:48,460
Okay.
