1
00:00:01,169 --> 00:00:04,269
You know, we towed Vito's

2
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:06,450
vehicle post, okay, and we

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,990
searched it, and we found

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:08,589
the very same

5
00:00:08,589 --> 00:00:09,789
shell casings that we found

6
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:10,630
at your house in the

7
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,369
back of his vehicle, spent.

8
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:16,149
We sent those off,

9
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,089
we had them tested against

10
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:18,449
the gun, and the shell

11
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,809
casings we found in the

12
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:21,890
cup holder in the back

13
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,370
seat of Vito's Explorer were

14
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,050
fired from the gun you

15
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,129
had in your possession that

16
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:32,399
day. And we can't

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,280
figure that out, man. We're

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,929
stuck. And that was the

19
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:37,229
ruse, because we were really

20
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:38,509
confident that

21
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:39,649
that they were going to

22
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:40,810
match. We had a working

23
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,259
theory that they planned the

24
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:43,840
murders at the

25
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,719
Waffle House, and Ryan gave

26
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,579
Vito a handgun to go

27
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:50,920
do some target shooting. We

28
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,560
don't understand how

29
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,630
that's the case. Could he

30
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,170
have stolen my gun out

31
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,469
of my truck? You tell

32
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:57,450
us. You know, you said

33
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:57,549
you

34
00:00:57,549 --> 00:00:59,229
never lost it anyway, so

35
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:00,990
that didn't happen. It wasn't

36
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,729
lost. Well, I mean, did

37
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,310
y 'all go target

38
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:03,649
practice?

39
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:09,170
No. Okay. Now, that's a

40
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,250
speed bump. We're just going

41
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,290
to have to figure out

42
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,310
what happened there,

43
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,489
why he has used your

44
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:17,250
gun to shoot stuff. He

45
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,450
must have taken it out

46
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,010
of my truck. When? How?

47
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:20,469
I don't

48
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:23,530
know. You could see the

49
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,510
wheels start turning in his

50
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:38,540
head. He didn't know they

51
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,159
were in that truck.

52
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,180
If he did, he forgot

53
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,019
about it. And then he

54
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:42,620
had to come up with

55
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,739
some other way that that

56
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:45,620
happened.

57
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,560
Okay.

58
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,680
What about Waffle House?

59
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:48,980
Waffle House.

60
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,109
You ever been to Waffle

61
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,609
House with him?

62
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:59,840
Let me think. Yes, one

63
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,680
night with him and Ann.

64
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,060
Why'd you leave that out?

65
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,439
Well, it's just, I don't

66
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,680
remember that. That's a petty

67
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,159
detail.

68
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,240
Ryan, that's Vito we're talking

69
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,800
about. All right. That's the

70
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,460
guy that killed him.

71
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,379
The guy you told me

72
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:15,560
on Sunday we met one

73
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,139
time.

74
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,580
I know, but that was

75
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,979
before. That was when he

76
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:23,319
was just a layabout presence.

77
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,099
It's just you and her

78
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:25,659
and him. It's not a

79
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:26,259
layabout presence.

80
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,020
It seems like they were

81
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,580
doing a lot of talking

82
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,060
at the table.

83
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:30,280
Y 'all were chatting it

84
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,219
up. Chatty Cathy, man.

85
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,599
Well, that's kind of what

86
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:32,960
I do.

87
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,340
Look, I remember, you know,

88
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,400
it took you saying it

89
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,939
to jog my memory that

90
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:38,860
I even went to Waffle

91
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,020
House.

92
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,979
You left out being with

93
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:41,840
the guy that killed your

94
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,539
entire family.

95
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,319
But I didn't, how could

96
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,159
I have known that at

97
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:45,639
the time?

98
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,219
It's possible you gave him

99
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:47,900
the gun to kill your

100
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,159
family.

101
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:48,780
No.

102
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,840
That's not possible.

103
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,180
No.

104
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,139
And how did his shell

105
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:52,259
casings get in his truck?

106
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:52,960
That's...

107
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,780
I don't know.

108
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:56,189
Well, I think I do.

109
00:02:56,689 --> 00:02:57,949
I think I do, too.

110
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:01,120
We've been waiting for you

111
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,979
to tell the truth here.

112
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,539
All you're doing is walking

113
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:04,939
in circles. You're dancing in

114
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:05,500
a circle here.

115
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,099
Okay? Man up.

116
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,479
Look, the only thing I

117
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,340
can think of is he

118
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,479
might have stolen it.

119
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:31,939
Even while he must have

120
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:32,520
stolen it.

121
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,259
Do you think anybody with

122
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:35,319
half a brain is going

123
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,199
to think that he stole

124
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,099
it and brought it back?

125
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:38,139
Maybe.

126
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,180
No, they're not, Ryan.

127
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:42,270
You're in a quandary.

128
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,340
This looks bad, because it

129
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:45,900
is bad.

130
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,639
Your whole family's dead and

131
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,400
you're alive, Ryan.

132
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,400
You got out of there

133
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,979
without a mark.

134
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,780
Listen to me. Don't talk.

135
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,139
The gun that was used

136
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:57,360
to kill your family was

137
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,240
given to Vito by you

138
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,449
for whatever reason.

139
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,229
I don't know if it

140
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:06,210
was for money or what,

141
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:08,189
but you gave Vito that

142
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:09,870
gun to come and assassinate

143
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,550
your family.

144
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:11,650
Okay?

145
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:12,930
They didn't deserve that.

146
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:14,229
And you can only make

147
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:15,129
that right...

148
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,389
...by being honest.

149
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,939
All I ever did was

150
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:21,920
try to help that kid.

151
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:23,319
The evidence doesn't suggest it.

152
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,399
I did that all the

153
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,519
time. That's what I do.

154
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,819
I help out. I bring

155
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:26,980
food.

156
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,860
Ryan, listen to me. Listen

157
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,279
to me.

158
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:29,339
You didn't help your mom,

159
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,180
your dad, and your sister.

160
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:31,220
There's a reason I have

161
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,639
that reputation. My dad was

162
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,639
the same way. He'd help

163
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:33,980
anybody.

164
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,339
Your dad's dead because of

165
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:35,759
you, Ryan.

166
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,879
My dad is not dead

167
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,459
because of me.

168
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:37,899
Yes, he is.

169
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,040
No, you can't be serious

170
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,319
right now. You can't be

171
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:42,779
serious.

172
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,040
Let's get down to the

173
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,399
nitty -gritty.

174
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,079
The duct tape was so

175
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:56,759
minimal on me.

176
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:56,860
It was so minimal on

177
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,199
you and so maximal on

178
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,279
your sister. It made no

179
00:04:59,279 --> 00:04:59,639
sense.

180
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,459
And your story today didn't

181
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:02,060
make any sense.

182
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:04,160
Listen, it's not believable.

183
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,879
It's not believable.

184
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:09,959
The only guy that survives

185
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,040
is you.

186
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,480
Your sister was shot three

187
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:13,860
times.

188
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,730
Your mom and dad are

189
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:15,910
dead.

190
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,480
The guy that, in my

191
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,620
opinion, you brought in there

192
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,420
to do all this stuff,

193
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:20,920
you killed.

194
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:22,990
I believe that happened.

195
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,589
Ryan, listen to me. Do

196
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:26,189
you see how this looks?

197
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:26,829
Do you hear where this

198
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:27,050
is going?

199
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,079
And then, yeah.

200
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,750
Can I go out and

201
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,189
smoke, please?

202
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:35,800
While y 'all have a

203
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:35,959
minute?

204
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:38,970
You're going to come back

205
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,569
about the fruit.

206
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:55,410
I have to give him

207
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,470
some contact information.

208
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:57,750
While we were outside, he

209
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,910
had that for Ernie.

210
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,649
Guys, look.

211
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:03,009
Y 'all have both been

212
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:04,470
decent and fair with me

213
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,029
throughout this whole process.

214
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,269
I think up until tonight.

215
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,970
And I know this isn't

216
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,490
a requirement for the job.

217
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,209
But one thing it definitely

218
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:15,189
wasn't was nice.

219
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:18,129
Or, you know, it was

220
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:18,850
not courtesy.

221
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:19,889
I understand that, Ryan.

222
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,170
But killing your family ain't

223
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:21,810
nice either, brother.

224
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:24,139
You know, and I've got

225
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:24,879
a job to do.

226
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,319
And so I don't really

227
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,279
care if he thinks I'm

228
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:27,839
nice or not.

229
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,079
You know, I want to

230
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:29,720
get to the bottom of

231
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,000
what happened.

232
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:32,620
You've got test results to

233
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,019
come in.

234
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,959
And what you're basing these

235
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,040
opinions on is something that

236
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,920
nobody can know.

237
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,339
What he was thinking, what

238
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:39,920
he was knowing.

239
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:40,680
Based on evidence.

240
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,639
And...

241
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,060
I mean, just put simply,

242
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,139
if y 'all have this...

243
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:48,199
Let me just have a

244
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,220
minute with Detective Miller.

245
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,100
I'll be back in a

246
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,100
minute.

247
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:50,660
That's for your lawyer.

248
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,699
I'm not asking you any

249
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:52,100
questions.

250
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:52,500
Okay.
