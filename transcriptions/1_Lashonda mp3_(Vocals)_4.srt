1
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:16,120
I'm trying to tell, I'm

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,019
telling you exactly what we're

3
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,579
seeing, and I'm asking you

4
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:20,420
to explain that.

5
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:22,440
Okay, you've told us that

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,859
you drive in circles, you

7
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:24,940
go around to these different

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,899
young boys' houses,

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,179
and you tell me that

10
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:28,140
you haunt the horn and

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:28,699
everything else.

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,440
You tell me that you

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,420
and your girlfriend are the

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,579
only ones that drive that

15
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:31,879
vehicle.

16
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:33,039
Yeah, I talk, yeah.

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,359
Okay.

18
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:34,920
Yes, sir.

19
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,380
I'm telling you exactly what

20
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,600
we're seeing. I'm asking for

21
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,140
an explanation, trying to understand.

22
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,380
Okay, I don't know when

23
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,799
you're actually talking about.

24
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,520
I'm talking about the night

25
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,579
Ms. Nix was killed.

26
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:49,119
Like I said, it's been

27
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,560
so much s*** that's been

28
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,600
going on, and I ride

29
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,200
by those kids' house numerous,

30
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:58,140
right, on a day, every

31
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,820
day, right?

32
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:01,799
So I don't know, I'm

33
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,140
not, I can't give you

34
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,120
an answer to that because

35
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,640
I'm not sure, right?

36
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:07,159
Okay.

37
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:09,040
When I'm there, when I

38
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,980
ride around and stuff.

39
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,019
These little places, like I

40
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:13,079
said, I don't know what's

41
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,079
be going on, what's going

42
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:14,920
to happen, or anything.

43
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,200
So I just be riding,

44
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:18,239
blowing.

45
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,560
Everybody know this is JJ

46
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:20,859
Dad.

47
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,400
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

48
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,000
hey, hey, hey.

49
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,400
Hey, this is the little

50
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,560
boy.

51
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:27,680
That's it.

52
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:29,680
I don't know about anything

53
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,180
else.

54
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:31,079
I don't know about no

55
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:31,359
shots.

56
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,540
I don't know about no

57
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,579
murders, no anything in that

58
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:35,439
nature, my brother.

59
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,299
I know I was getting

60
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:56,120
the s***.

61
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:57,680
Now, response as well, I

62
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,079
was like, you know, the

63
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,129
way that you guys are

64
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:01,870
looking at me and the

65
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,930
way that you're acting towards

66
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,870
me, it make me shut

67
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,329
down.

68
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,790
This is the deal.

69
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:08,030
Your emotions that you had

70
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,689
when you came in here,

71
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,389
those are real.

72
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,789
You're hurting for your son.

73
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:11,250
I'm hurting.

74
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,449
Your son's s*** right now.

75
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:13,189
He's still hurting.

76
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:14,569
My son just got out

77
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:15,370
of the hospital yesterday.

78
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:16,469
And he's still got a

79
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,289
long road of recovery.

80
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:18,469
It's going to take some

81
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:18,729
time.

82
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,599
But what we're telling you,

83
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,199
I believe that too.

84
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:25,370
And there's some stuff in

85
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,370
your story that has been

86
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,469
accurate and has been.

87
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,129
Truthful about you driving by.

88
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:30,490
We have several videos of

89
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,610
you driving by, which has

90
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,789
verified that, just like you

91
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:32,990
said.

92
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:34,710
And we believe that you

93
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,949
were there in front of

94
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:37,090
that house at the time

95
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,650
that shooting happened, doing the

96
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,490
doot, doot, doot with your

97
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:39,909
horn, too.

98
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,509
So that's why my partner

99
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:42,509
is asking you to explain

100
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:42,750
it.

101
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:44,210
You get one opportunity to

102
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:44,870
tell your side of the

103
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,030
story of what happened.

104
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,050
But you were there in

105
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:47,830
front of that house at

106
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,590
that time of the shooting.

107
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,009
Not just me.

108
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,830
It was other people there,

109
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,030
too.

110
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,259
You're not being a c***,

111
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,259
alright, but you also have

112
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:07,419
to understand, I mean, put

113
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:08,879
yourself, let's switch roles.

114
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,460
Here, right?

115
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,360
Put yourself on this side

116
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,659
of the table.

117
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:10,979
I did.

118
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,900
I know.

119
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,780
That's why I know.

120
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:13,639
I know.

121
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,000
I know.

122
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,580
I know.

123
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,419
What you're telling.

124
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,379
I know it looks bad,

125
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,080
but you were pissed off.

126
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,919
I can't cooperate.

127
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,840
You guys are sorry.

128
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,979
As if I don't agree

129
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:23,060
that this is how I

130
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,099
can do nothing.

131
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:28,990
Come on, man.

132
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,229
Man, I didn't do nothing,

133
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:31,490
man.

134
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,289
I'm telling you that you

135
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:34,210
didn't hear a shot.

136
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:36,789
I'm seriously telling you, I

137
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:37,770
did not do anything.

138
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:39,689
I want to do something

139
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:40,490
to the little boy.

140
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:41,770
That harmed my son.

141
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:42,590
Did you mean to do

142
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,310
it to him and you

143
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,009
hit her accidentally?

144
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,139
No, ma 'am.

145
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:49,789
No, ma 'am.

146
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,139
No, ma 'am.

147
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:52,819
Mr.

148
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,900
Johnson, the look of surprise

149
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,639
on your face.

150
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:55,360
You got to be kidding

151
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,580
me.

152
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,300
You're a smart guy.

153
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,539
You hear the words that

154
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:59,139
are coming out of your

155
00:03:59,139 --> 00:03:59,439
mouth.

156
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,719
You're putting yourself on the

157
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,759
block, right?

158
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,020
Honking the horn at the

159
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,879
time of this thing.

160
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,159
And you're telling us you

161
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:05,879
didn't hear a shot.

162
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,340
Are you on something?

163
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:10,639
Are you a drinker?

164
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:11,379
Do you use any drugs?

165
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,020
I mean, is there an

166
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,020
explanation for this?

167
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:14,900
No.

168
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:16,819
Help us understand this.

169
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,540
That's all this is.

170
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,560
I mean, help us understand

171
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:18,839
it.

172
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,329
The understanding is I didn't

173
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:25,370
touch anybody, mommy.

174
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:26,990
I didn't touch anybody.

175
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:28,680
I didn't say.

176
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:30,439
Yeah, we didn't say you

177
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:30,959
took something.

178
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,100
I did not touch anybody.

179
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,420
I did not do anything.

180
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:34,980
I didn't shoot any guns.

181
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:37,459
You'll catch a knife in

182
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:37,899
my car.

183
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,060
I don't have any guns

184
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,660
at all.

185
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,750
I'm trying to be as

186
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,110
honest as straight up as

187
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,189
you are to abortion.

188
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:46,170
And then you stop when

189
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,170
you guys are true.

190
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,350
Because this is your chance

191
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,069
to get it off of

192
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:51,209
you.

193
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,949
You have to understand these

194
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:53,910
kids recognize you.

195
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,110
They know who you are,

196
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:55,790
just like you know who

197
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,110
they are.

198
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,009
Yes, I know.

199
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:57,589
They've been with me.

200
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,730
So they've seen you as

201
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,689
you left out of there.

202
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:00,730
They've been with me for

203
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,050
eight years plus.

204
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:04,110
OK, so these kids, like

205
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,029
the little other J .J.

206
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:05,790
kid, he would know who

207
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,629
you are or the other

208
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:08,269
kids that live there.

209
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:09,250
All of them.

210
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:09,970
You don't think that they

211
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,129
didn't see you leave from

212
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:12,569
there after their mom was

213
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:12,810
shot?

214
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:14,649
Miss Lady. Killed on the

215
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:15,449
ground right in front of

216
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:15,649
them.

217
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:17,050
And her grandbaby.

218
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:22,040
I didn't kill nobody, man.

219
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:24,279
I didn't kill nobody.

220
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,980
I tell you that that's

221
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:32,850
what happens.

222
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,300
That's what happened, sir.

223
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,879
You haven't really told us

224
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,120
anything.

225
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:40,449
We mean, that's what happened.

226
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:42,649
That's that's that's what that's

227
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:43,189
what I did.

228
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,550
What did you do?

229
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,949
I just drove around.

230
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:48,850
Just drove around. I just

231
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,610
drove around.

232
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,730
And just in your mind's

233
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,110
eye, in your mind's eye

234
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,610
for me.

235
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,189
You know, cook like you're

236
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,250
driving up to the street,

237
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,490
driving up to the house.

238
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:58,110
Right. Tell me what you're

239
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,290
saying.

240
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,149
Tell me what you're hearing.

241
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,009
Tell me what happens.

242
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:04,810
Nothing, nothing at all.

243
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,410
I can't believe that just

244
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,430
based it was just you

245
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:08,990
and I talking.

246
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:10,550
Right. And I didn't have

247
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,490
these other things.

248
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,750
You wasn't afforded this this

249
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,930
video with audio.

250
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:16,350
You wasn't going to believe

251
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:16,829
me anyway.

252
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,170
Are you sure? Positive.

253
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,470
If you gave me that,

254
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,569
if I understood.

255
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:23,490
Right. If I understood from

256
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:23,709
you.

257
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,689
But you're not telling me

258
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:24,889
anything.

259
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,730
You're telling me you drove

260
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,089
by.

261
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:27,569
You were there honking the

262
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:28,050
horn, whatever.

263
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:29,269
But you didn't hear you

264
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:30,149
didn't hear a gunshot.

265
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:31,769
You would never understand.

266
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,730
Try me. I did what

267
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,529
you would do.

268
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:37,550
OK. And you guys put

269
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,129
me over here

270
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,829
and interrogate me and try

271
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:43,089
to give me a story

272
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:44,949
that you make up for

273
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:45,230
me.

274
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,509
When I told you what

275
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:50,069
happened, I told you about

276
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:52,709
my son being like that.

277
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,509
Right. You did.

278
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,529
You guys.

279
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:03,990
I'm sorry. And I truly

280
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,810
mean that.

281
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,769
I'm a father myself.

282
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:07,970
It's not active. How do

283
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,250
you know?

284
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,709
Because I know I see

285
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:10,730
because I see the little

286
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,569
dude on Facebook showing my

287
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:13,129
son gun.

288
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,250
He said and he said,

289
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,949
oh, I mean, it's not

290
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:17,310
active.

291
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:19,329
Little little dude's face.

292
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:20,589
Have you talked to an

293
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:21,730
investigator? No.

294
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,209
So before you say that

295
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,290
it's inactive, you need to

296
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:24,990
get the facts on it.

297
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,889
And that's the thing. I'm

298
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:27,509
not making a story yet.

299
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,769
I'm based on the facts

300
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:29,269
that I've been

301
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:30,550
spending for the last week

302
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,269
and me and my partner

303
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:32,629
have on facts that we've

304
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:33,009
gathered

305
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:34,550
in evidence to put you

306
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,790
in.

307
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,050
This spot. We didn't put

308
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,529
you in here.

309
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,509
We didn't just go pick

310
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:38,370
you up just randomly.

311
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:40,110
It's based on evidence that

312
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,649
we've gathered.

313
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,529
And it's facts.

314
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:43,699
OK, straight facts.

315
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:45,060
OK, it's not.

316
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,870
I'm just trying to understand

317
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,389
what happened.

318
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,620
Is it because because what

319
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,879
I'm looking at, I think

320
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,699
I know what happened.

321
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,420
I'm pretty sure I do.

322
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:58,040
You keep telling me that

323
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,160
if you knew what happened,

324
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,160
you would get the idea.

325
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,480
And instead of having me

326
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,019
out here, that's what you

327
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:04,399
would do.

328
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,360
Well, yeah. Who did it

329
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,500
then?

330
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:07,519
Because of the fact.

331
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,240
My son is shot in

332
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,620
the face.

333
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:11,420
Nobody's down.

334
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,670
I'm down here.

335
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,790
I wasn't asked, well, did

336
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,970
you have an alibi or

337
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:18,990
know anything?

338
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:21,589
I'm just automatically guilty because

339
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:22,550
you've seen my car.

340
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:23,670
I didn't even I didn't

341
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,410
even do anything.

342
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:27,339
I didn't even do any

343
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:28,199
game.

344
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:47,039
And then I'm seriously telling

345
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,879
you, you know, I do

346
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,559
anything.

347
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,659
I want to do something

348
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:52,000
to the little boy that

349
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,779
harmed my son.

350
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,879
Did you mean to him?

351
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:54,120
Did you hit him and

352
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,980
you hit her accidentally?

353
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,480
No, ma 'am. No, ma

354
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:00,759
'am.

355
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:03,129
No, ma 'am.

356
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,549
Mr. Johnson, the look of

357
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:05,610
surprise on your face.

358
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:06,350
You got to be kidding

359
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,269
me. You're a smart guy.

360
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,519
You have the words that

361
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,120
are coming out of your

362
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,419
mouth.

363
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,700
You're putting yourself on the

364
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,740
block, right?

365
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,000
Honking the horn at the

366
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,840
time of this thing.

367
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,139
And you're telling us you

368
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:16,860
didn't hear a shot.

369
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,360
You have to understand these

370
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,340
kids recognize you.

371
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,539
They know who you are,

372
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,240
just like you know who

373
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,539
they are.

374
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,440
Yes, I know.

375
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,899
They've been they've seen you

376
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:24,980
and you left out of

377
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,120
there.

378
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,159
They've been with me for

379
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:26,940
eight years.

380
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:29,279
Plus, OK, so these kids,

381
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:30,299
like the little other J

382
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:30,460
.J.

383
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,299
kid, he would know you

384
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:32,059
or the other.

385
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,480
Yes, the kids that live

386
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:33,720
there.

387
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,139
All of you don't think

388
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:35,919
that they didn't see you

389
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,460
leave from there after their

390
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:37,799
mom

391
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,980
was shot, mislead, killed on

392
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,759
the ground right in front

393
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,539
of them and her grandbaby.

394
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:47,470
I didn't kill nobody, man.

395
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:49,710
I didn't kill nobody.

396
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,330
I tell you that that

397
00:09:51,330 --> 00:10:05,240
I did what you would

398
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,519
do.

399
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,539
OK, and you guys put

400
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:11,399
me over here and interrogate

401
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,200
me and try to give

402
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,980
me a story that you

403
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,000
make up for me when

404
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,879
I told you what happened.

405
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:20,379
I told you about my

406
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:22,700
son being like that.

407
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,590
Right. You did.

408
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:32,029
You guys think I'm based

409
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:33,110
on the facts that I've

410
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,049
been spending for the last

411
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:34,549
week

412
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:35,230
and me and my partner

413
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,590
have on facts that we've

414
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,289
gathered in evidence to put

415
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:39,149
you in this spot.

416
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,350
We didn't put you in

417
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:40,529
here.

418
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,490
We didn't just go pick

419
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,289
you up just randomly.

420
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,090
It's based on evidence that

421
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,529
we've gathered and it's facts.

422
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:46,960
OK.

423
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,039
It's not.

424
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,970
I understand.

425
00:10:51,330 --> 00:11:16,240
Mr. Johnson, you got upset

426
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,299
with us when we told

427
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:18,500
you about the evidence that

428
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:18,820
we do

429
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,340
have, and I just asked

430
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,779
you to simply just to

431
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,799
explain and try to explain

432
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,480
and help us

433
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,139
understand how how we got

434
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:26,759
it wrong.

435
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,720
You know what I mean?

436
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,009
Can you help us?

437
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,029
Because we're not we're not

438
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:31,309
there.

439
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:32,490
I was going to say,

440
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:34,149
yeah, you didn't you didn't

441
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:34,909
get it wrong, man.

442
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:36,110
You've got to do what

443
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,889
you have to do, because

444
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:37,570
that's your job.

445
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,860
I'm going to ask you

446
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:46,240
these clothes and stuff.

447
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,080
These clothes.

448
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,679
Do you still have those

449
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:47,980
clothes?

450
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:51,299
That ain't me.

451
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,399
That's not you?

452
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:52,860
No.
