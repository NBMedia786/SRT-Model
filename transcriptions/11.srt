1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,700
He cut slices out of

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,509
the tree. We sent him

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:07,969
off to a botanist. He

4
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:10,330
examined the tree, its age,

5
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:12,429
its growth rings, and said

6
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,169
that tree was damaged in

7
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:15,890
the early growing season of

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,010
2010, spring or summer.

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,250
That tree damage, according to

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,769
the testimony of a botanist

11
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:23,190
from the University of Wisconsin,

12
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,289
was reminiscent of a fire

13
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:26,929
and appears to have happened

14
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,489
at the same time Nathan

15
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:30,170
claimed Bonnie's body had been

16
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:30,469
burned.

17
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:33,030
As a prosecutor, why is

18
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,990
that critical?

19
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:36,789
That fire, others have testified,

20
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:38,170
had to be quite large

21
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,210
to burn a body like

22
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,469
that down to the fragments

23
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:43,130
that we found.

24
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,530
There's a question, was there

25
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,950
actually evidence of a fire?

26
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:48,429
Or is it a fire

27
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:49,750
around the time of 2010?

28
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:51,390
Or is it not a

29
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,170
fire? That's questionable.

30
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,509
Heather Woodward, Bonnie's stepdaughter, takes

31
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:58,030
the stand and tells jurors

32
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,609
that she told Roger about

33
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,409
Bonnie's whereabouts and her work

34
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:01,670
schedule.

35
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:04,390
How did Heather do on

36
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,129
the stand? What was her

37
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:05,890
testimony like?

38
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,500
It was pretty short, and

39
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,239
I think the way that

40
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,859
Heather was in the police

41
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:12,920
interviews is the way she

42
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,640
was on the stand.

43
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:15,500
I never wanted that to

44
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,680
happen to Bonnie. I mean,

45
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,500
sometimes I knew how she

46
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,719
was being, but I wouldn't

47
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:20,500
do that to her.

48
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,840
Her testimony, it pretty much

49
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,920
tracked with that, but it

50
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,180
was clear to those involved

51
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,819
that she had not participated

52
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:29,819
in her mother's death.

53
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,599
What made her cry on

54
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,280
the stand, do you remember?

55
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,040
Every time she cried, it

56
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,019
was because she said, I

57
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:36,299
never wanted this to happen

58
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,379
to Bonnie. I never meant

59
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:38,200
for this to happen to

60
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,480
Bonnie.

61
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,400
Bonnie's boyfriend, Gary, took to

62
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,819
the stand, too, and told

63
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:44,939
the jury about what was

64
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,719
lost when Bonnie's life was

65
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,180
cut short.

66
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,079
He wouldn't look back at

67
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,140
me for nothing. I kept

68
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,879
looking across where he was,

69
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,560
and he wouldn't look at

70
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:53,700
me.

71
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,200
So I started talking to

72
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
the jury to my right,

73
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,019
and I said he took

74
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:00,379
away a good woman, mother.

75
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,319
I let him know what

76
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,060
kind of person he was.

77
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,460
I have an old supervisor.

78
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
Before I started my very

79
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,419
first body case, which I'll

80
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:13,800
never forget, he said,

81
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,319
always remember, the jury can

82
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,759
see the soul of your

83
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,699
victim reflected in the eyes

84
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:19,819
of those who love them.

85
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,699
When it was their turn,

86
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,860
the defense team laid out

87
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,960
a case that pointed the

88
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,680
finger at Nathan as Bonnie's

89
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:25,900
killer,

90
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,500
and argued that without him

91
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,759
and the so -called golden

92
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,539
ticket, the state's case was

93
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:31,620
just circumstantial.

94
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,080
Nathan didn't have a choice.

95
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,560
Nathan didn't help his father

96
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,099
dispose.

97
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,280
Of this crime, Nathan's a

98
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,699
dead man. And let's not

99
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:42,620
forget, he was a barely

100
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,819
16 -year -old boy.

101
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,960
Roger did not testify at

102
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,300
trial. It's his choice whether

103
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,219
or not to testify, and

104
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:49,039
he decided not to.

105
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,000
He was advised not to

106
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,780
testify. Many attorneys advise their

107
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,860
clients not to testify,

108
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:56,599
because, one thing, they think

109
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,439
it will shift the burden.

110
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,060
They think the jury's going

111
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,960
to look at whether they

112
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,699
believe the defendant,

113
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,400
and suddenly the defendant has

114
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,580
to prove his innocence, which

115
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,460
he normally doesn't have to

116
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:04,680
do.

117
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,680
After five days...

118
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,360
The case is now in

119
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,159
the hands of the jury.

120
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,620
It was back and forth,

121
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,340
all the way.

122
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:12,500
Those moments are always very

123
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:12,860
tense.

124
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,199
We would get close, and

125
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,500
then somebody would say something

126
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,479
else, and then it would

127
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,360
throw everything off.

128
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,259
What was the hang -up

129
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:18,419
then?

130
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,199
The cases have been presented,

131
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,020
and now the verdict is

132
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,639
in the hands of the

133
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:34,900
jury.

134
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,490
It was back and forth,

135
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,050
all the way, truly, till

136
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,930
the end. We were back

137
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:40,330
and forth.

138
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,389
And we thought we would

139
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,710
get close, and then somebody

140
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,710
would say something else,

141
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:47,610
and then it would throw

142
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,189
everything off.

143
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:49,250
What was the hang -up

144
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:49,430
then?

145
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:51,370
We all agreed that he

146
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,569
definitely had a hand in

147
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:53,789
this.

148
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,509
The hang -up was, basically,

149
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:56,990
did he do it, or

150
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,310
was he covering for someone

151
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,169
else that did it?

152
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:01,909
When you finally reached a

153
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,550
decision, what was the feeling

154
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,129
in the room? Relief?

155
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:08,409
We truly did our due

156
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:09,969
diligence on deliberating correctly.

157
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,620
We were notified that the

158
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,039
jury had a verdict, so

159
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,439
we all went back to

160
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:15,860
the courtroom,

161
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,180
and those moments are always

162
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,720
very tense.

163
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,920
Roger Carroll was found guilty

164
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,220
of first -degree murder.

165
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,310
And so when the verdict

166
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,509
was read, how did the

167
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:28,209
courtroom respond?

168
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,110
Crying from both sides, happy

169
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,029
on Bonnie's side, sad on

170
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:33,769
Roger's side,

171
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,430
and, again, Roger never, he

172
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,949
never made any emotion. He

173
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:40,339
just sat there.

174
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,980
He didn't even react?

175
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:43,699
Mm -mm.

176
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,720
What went through your mind

177
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,620
when you heard the verdict?

178
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:47,500
Bonnie.

179
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,540
Um, that finally she could

180
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,139
be at peace.

181
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,240
That she could rest.

182
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,800
Um, I don't believe in

183
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,819
the word closure. It doesn't

184
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:57,920
exist in my mind.

185
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,959
Um, but that Bonnie can

186
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,040
now rest peacefully.

187
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,180
By the time of sentencing,

188
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:06,199
the charges against Roger for

189
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:08,199
domestic violence and obstruction were

190
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:08,600
dropped.

191
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,300
At the sentencing hearing, Roger

192
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,180
was given the opportunity to

193
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,199
make a statement to the

194
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:14,519
court,

195
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,500
and he chose to use

196
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,019
that time to be defiant.

197
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,579
He said, I don't have

198
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:21,779
anything to be sorry for.

199
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,240
I won't apologize because I've

200
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,899
done nothing wrong.

201
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,980
And that says a lot

202
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,000
about his mindset.

203
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,660
Sure does.

204
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,560
When I heard the jury

205
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,819
found him guilty, that was

206
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:37,139
a blessing to my ears

207
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:37,519
to hear.

208
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,540
Wish he could have got

209
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,759
more time than he did.

210
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,279
He was charged with first

211
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,699
-degree murder, um, while using

212
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:45,339
a firearm.

213
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,060
He received 40 years in

214
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,300
the Department of Corrections for

215
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,240
the murder, plus 25 years

216
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,579
for the gun enhancement.

217
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,889
At least it did lock

218
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:57,269
him up.

219
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,230
I give him that.

220
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,949
The police finally making him

221
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:02,050
pay for what he did.

222
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,300
Roger Carroll robbed her kids,

223
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,579
her grandkids, friends, family.

224
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:21,560
But we won't never forget

225
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:21,800
her.

226
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,420
And we won't forget him.

227
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,209
People describe her as somebody

228
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:29,850
who had a really loving

229
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,189
heart.

230
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:31,589
I know, she definitely did.

231
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,879
Like, even, especially with family,

232
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,920
like, didn't matter what you

233
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,060
did.

234
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,879
She would figure out a

235
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,300
way to,

236
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,100
just make it better.

237
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,199
You really loved her.

238
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,300
Oh, yeah. Like, she was

239
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:48,519
great.

240
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:51,459
Sometimes I'll look up at

241
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:55,740
the sky and tell her

242
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,339
I don't know if I'll

243
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:57,660
be there, but, uh, I

244
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,680
hope someday I will.

245
00:06:58,819 --> 00:06:59,660
And see you again.

246
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,540
So many of Bonnie's loved

247
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,600
ones wishing they could see

248
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,060
her again.

249
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,980
Bonnie Woodward's killer, Roger Carroll,

250
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,339
is appealing his conviction.

251
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,160
He was granted permission for

252
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,319
that appeal by the Illinois

253
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,300
Supreme Court.

254
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:18,500
And his case will likely

255
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,759
be argued this fall.

256
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,759
That's our program for tonight.

257
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,620
Thanks for watching.

258
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,660
I'm Deborah Roberts.

259
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:24,620
And I'm David Muir from

260
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,279
all of us here at

261
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,560
20 -20 and ABC News.

262
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,519
Good night.
