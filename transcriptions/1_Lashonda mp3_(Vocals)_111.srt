Please, please, the violence in

00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:03,136
this town is out of

3
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:03,603
control.

4
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:05,438
Somebody is going to jail.

5
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:09,209
Sit up.

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:13,580
Bullet hole.

7
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:14,781
Careful.

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,251
St. Paul Police!

9
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,452
See the bullet hole?

10
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:20,754
It's the police!

11
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:21,621
It's the cops!

12
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:22,522
Open the door!

Come on, look!

14
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,058
No!

15
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,359
It's the police!

16
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:27,293

00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:31,031
Don't talk!

21
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:32,599
Get out of the way!

22
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,833
See the...

23
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:35,535
Come here.

24
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:36,036
Come here.

25
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:36,069
Oh, yeah.

26
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:41,674
Oh, no.

27
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:53,686
Tell me what was...

28
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:55,455
Hey, there's nothing here.

29
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,257
What did this woman want

30
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:57,457
to do?

31
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,091
Tell me.

32
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,194
She was unresponsive when we

33
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:01,461
arrived.

34
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:02,095
She what?

35
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,229
Unresponsive.

36
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:03,930
No, not that.

37
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,464
She is a...

38
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,166
Let me stop.

39
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:18,545
Had this dream already of

40
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:18,745
this.

41
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,480
I know what you guys

42
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,414
are going to do to

43
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:21,881
me, sir.

44
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,451
I know it already, man.

45
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:26,753
I know it already.

46
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,994
I don't know what's the

47
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:35,261
emergency.

48
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,101
What's happening there?

49
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,603
What's happening there?

50
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:44,904
Mom, she got shot.

51
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,172
Where is the suspect?

52
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,341
I don't know.

53
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,943
What is your name, please?

54
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,145
Okay, do you need to

55
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,046
talk to a medical...

56
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:53,847
Do you need to talk

57
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:54,914
to a medical dispatcher?

58
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:55,682
Hold on one, please.

59
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,251
Come here now.

60
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,453
I will talk to whoever.

61
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,322
Okay, listen to me now.

62
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,623
Where is that being called

63
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,257
right now?

64
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,458
What part of the body

65
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,159
was she shot?

66
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,393
I don't know.

67
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:08,862
Just hurry.

68
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:09,362
Okay.

69
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,096
She awake?

70
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:13,333
Okay.

71
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,134
Okay.

72
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:14,534
Listen to me.

73
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,301
We've got...

74
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,870
Help's coming right now, okay?

75
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,638
Hurry up.

76
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,473
Are you not scared that

77
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,407
you can start CPR?

78
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:22,575
No, I'm hurt.

79
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,612
Okay, sit next to her

80
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:26,479
so you can help her.

81
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,314
Mom, I'm scared.

82
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,484
Okay, then don't do it.

83
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,585
Then don't do that, okay?

84
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:56,776
Pull it, Paul.

85
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,011
Careful.

86
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,447
St. Paul Police.

87
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:02,649
See the bullet hole?

88
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:03,983
It's the police.

89
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:04,851
It's the cops.

90
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:05,718
Open the door.

91
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,020
It's the police.

92
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:07,987

00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:13,526
Hurry.

00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:13,993
Don't.

102
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:14,494
Don't.

103
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:15,161
Yeah.

104
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:15,662
Don't do this.

105
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:16,829
See that?

106
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:18,765
Come here.

107
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:19,365

Do it.

111
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:27,373
You start it.

112
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,107
We don't talk.

113
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,108
We don't talk.

114
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:29,809

I don't know.

116
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,645
We'll talk to the doctors.

117
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,248
And police.

118
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:36,783
All right.

119
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:36,916
Go.

120
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,784
I didn't have to.

121
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:38,551
I don't know.

122
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:39,786
I don't know.

123
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:39,986
I don't know how many

124
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:40,853
people are up there.

125
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:41,754
To the whole partner.

126
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:42,755
Don't let them come out.

127
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:44,357
Don't.

Squad 387.

138
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,545
We'll just leave that medic

139
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:06,312
to come out.

140
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:06,946
Shot the little boy.

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,184
See that?

143
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:11,784
There's one.

144
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:12,685
One out.

145
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,120

146
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:14,587
One out.

147
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,521
Come on.

148
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,256
I'm going to do it.

149
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,190

00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:20,460
I'm going to do it.

155
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:20,893
I'm going to do it.

156
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:21,995
I'm going to do it.

157
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:22,929
I'm going to do it.

158
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,163
I'm going to do it.

159
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:40,413
I'm going to do it.

160
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,415
I'm going to do it.

161
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,821
You could just stay out

162
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,123
because he has to just...

163
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:50,590
All right.

164
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,391
You know what I'm saying?

165
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:52,258
Okay.

166
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,028
That's a well -known arrival.

167
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:56,195
Where are you going?

168
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:57,664
She was right here.

169
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,867
She was unresponsive when we

170
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:01,167
arrived.

171
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:01,801
She what?

172
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:02,935
Unresponsive.

173
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,837
She was like, thank you.

174
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:05,838
May I stop?

175
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:06,839
She passed away.

176
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,207
Sister, yeah.

177
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,309
I mean, it's traumatic.

178
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,576
It's a traumatic arrest.

179
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,979
Whatever you guys want to

180
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,179
do.

181
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,013
Oh, we're done.

182
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,114
I mean, she is...

183
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:15,281
Yes.

184
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,450
It's a well -involved, right?

185
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:17,884
Yes.

186
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:18,718
Here.

187
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:19,886
Why are you...

188
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:20,553
It's not a...

189
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:21,754
Why is he...

190
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:22,221
All right.

191
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:22,889
Right.

192
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:23,956
It's a traumatic arrest.

193
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,158
He's a PA of a

194
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:25,558
boss party.

195
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:26,192
Oh, I'm glad.

196
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,026
I'm close.

197
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:27,827
I think...

198
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,195
Yeah, we're just calling it.

199
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:29,929
Hi.

200
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:30,363
Hi.

201
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,030
All right.

202
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:31,998
I'm 64.

203
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:32,432
Oh.

204
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,448
Who are you looking for?

205
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:48,981
Hey, but...

206
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,016
Hey, he's nothing.

207
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:50,516
I'm rants.

208
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,284
What?

209
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:51,718
What?

210
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:52,318
What's...

211
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,319
So, are you...

212
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,687
Is China any football for

213
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:54,854
me?

214
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,956
Dude, I don't know what

215
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:57,423
they got there.

216
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,191
What is it?

217
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,092
The black...

218
00:05:59,092 --> 00:05:59,659
Oh, the old...

219
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,026
It's over the window.

220
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:00,593
I just...

221
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,395
Maybe she pulled it to

222
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,029
look at it.

223
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:03,696
Plank it.

224
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,597
Pulled the drawer.

225
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,432
All right.

226
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,700
I will work on getting

227
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,401
you a name.

228
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:08,701
Right.

229
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:09,569
Just in case.

230
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:09,969
All right.

231
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,557
They walked through the porch.

232
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:32,759
They banged on the door.

233
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,227
We asked who was it.

234
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,228
They didn't say nothing.

235
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:35,995
What did you guys see?

236
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,063
White GMC.

237
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,798
I saw that White GMC.

238
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:39,632
White GMC?

239
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:39,932
Yes.

240
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:40,767
White GMC.

241
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:40,867
White GMC.

242
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:41,401
White GMC who shot up?

243
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:43,503
Newer or older?

244
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:44,170
I was going to say

245
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,738
he saw White GMC.

246
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:46,572
All right.

247
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,573
Hold on.

248
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:48,474
I'm sorry.

249
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:48,941
Just stay here.

250
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:49,275
Okay.

251
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,411
3 -6 -5.

252
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,044
You're lying.

253
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:52,645
I heard you say a

254
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:53,746
suspect came in a White

255
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,046
GMC.

256
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:54,981
That's JJ Dad.

257
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:55,882
I just sat there.

258
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,350
Oh, my God.

259
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,751
Oh, my God.

260
00:06:58,851 --> 00:06:59,452
Did you see who the

261
00:06:59,452 --> 00:06:59,852
shooter was?

262
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,254
Okay.

263
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,022
We had an incident here

264
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,357
a few days ago.

265
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:04,991
What's his name?

266
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,726
And my brother Frank, he

267
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,227
had died in an incident.

268
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,262
And that was his dad

269
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,062
that just came to shot

270
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:10,296
my mom.

271
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,697
What was his name?

272
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,666
His name is Terrell Johnson.

273
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:14,467
That's his name?

274
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,203
Terrell Durell Johnson.

275
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:18,905
Terrell Durell Johnson.

276
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:19,872
And did you see him?

277
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:20,473
What?

278
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,141
Did you see him?

279
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,142
No, we didn't see him.

280
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,010
Why do you think it's

281
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,076
him?

282
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:24,977
Because.

283
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,312
Because it's Trump.

284
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:26,913
Because it's Trump.

285
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,447
I know.

286
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,481
I swear I know.

287
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,081
I've never.

288
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:29,682
I don't.

289
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:30,516
How old is this?

290
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,417
How old is he?

291
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,285
I don't know how old

292
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:32,518
he is.

293
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,052
Is he older?

294
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:33,786
I mean, is he 20?

295
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:34,353
Is he 40?

296
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:34,954
We don't know.

297
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:35,855
We don't know.

298
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,090
What did you guys see

299
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:38,324
in here?

300
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:38,691
This is.

301
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,059
We didn't see or hear

302
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:40,460
anything.

303
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:40,760
Nothing.

304
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,494
Were you guys here?

305
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:42,428
Yes.

306
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,564
We was just upstairs playing

307
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:45,131
board games.

308
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,732
We was just upstairs playing

309
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:47,233
board games.

310
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:47,533
Yeah.

311
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,101
And somebody knocked on her

312
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:49,302
door.

313
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,036
She went to go see

314
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:50,770
who it was and they

315
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,304
shot her.

316
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:51,771
Okay.

317
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,306
And then you saw the

318
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,774
white GMC take off.

319
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:55,908
Which way did it go?

320
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:56,976
Wait.

321
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:57,777
This way.

322
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,078
Car was parked this way.

323
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,113
That way towards Maine?

324
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:01,514
This way.

325
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:01,914
Yes.

326
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,249
I can't see past this

327
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:03,449
outside.

328
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:04,083
Okay.

329
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,452
I can't see past like.

330
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,854
I'm not white.

331
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,754
I can see the pizza

332
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:09,155
thorns.

333
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:10,323
I can see that.

334
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:11,257
Yes.

335
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,058
The house is clear.

336
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,994
I haven't gone back there

337
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,161
yet.

338
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:15,661
Have you guys?

339
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:16,996
Can you do these dance?

340
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,297
In the trail.

341
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:19,565
Terrell Johnson.

342
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:20,700
Terrell.

343
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,801
Terrell Darrell Johnson.

344
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,636
After G .J. got shot.

345
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:23,970
Yes.

346
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:24,504
Yes.

347
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,239
Everybody's number.

348
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,440
Oh, my God.

349
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,108
I already did.

350
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,910
When was the last time

351
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,177
you guys saw each other?

352
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,479
I haven't seen Darnell at

353
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:33,746
all.

354
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:34,881
You got to know.

355
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,148
What the fuck?

356
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:36,716
Oh, my God.

357
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:37,717
I don't know.

358
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:38,684
That's G .J.

359
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,219
That's G .J.

360
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,120
I can't see him.

361
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,021
I can't see him.

362
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:42,288
I can't see him.

363
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:43,256
I can't see him.

364
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:43,356
I can't see him.

365
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,156
I can't see him.

366
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:44,924
I can't see him.

367
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:45,291
I can't see him.

368
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:45,658
I can't see him.

369
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:46,225
I can't see him.

370
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,126
I can't see him.

371
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:48,227
I can't see him.

372
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,763
I can't see him.

373
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,367
Do you know where Terrell

374
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:54,567
lives?

375
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:55,668
No, I don't.

376
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,404
He said it was a

377
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:58,871
white game.

378
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:02,808
It's like a...

379
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:03,643
It's like Chuck.

380
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:04,210
Right.

381
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:06,746
That's the last time you

382
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:07,079
saw him.

383
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:08,481
Was there anything that you

384
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:08,981
saw about...

385
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,182
Like, was it a new...

386
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:10,750
I don't know how long.

387
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,518
Was it new, old...

388
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:13,619
It was like a new

389
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,020
arrangement.

390
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:19,058
Oh, yeah.

391
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:19,959
I don't know.

392
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,260
I can't see, but it

393
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,394
was...

394
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,662
Like a big, like a

395
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,596
full -size SUV?

396
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,398
Yeah, when they're done.

397
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:25,565
Okay.

398
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:28,935
My bad.

399
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:29,602
I didn't mean to call

400
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:29,735
you.

401
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:31,170
What do you think?

402
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:31,537
What do you think?

403
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:32,038
When was the last time

404
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,039
you saw that car parked

405
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,306
outside?

406
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,341
About, like, a few days

407
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:35,641
ago.

408
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,677
Right after JJ got trapped?

409
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,146
Have you seen it at

410
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:40,646
all today?

411
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,984
This was private, bro.

412
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:47,787
You have to think about

413
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,089
it.
He came here one day,

414
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,425
tried to come in.

415
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,293
Nobody opened the door.

416
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:55,928
Then he just came back.
