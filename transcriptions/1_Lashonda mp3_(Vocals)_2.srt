1
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:12,750
My partner is going to

2
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,629
kind of talk to you

3
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:14,210
about what you're doing.

4
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:14,650
Do you have any idea

5
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,229
what you're doing here?

6
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:16,979
I do.

7
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,479
Tell me about that.

8
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,969
So, my kid gets shots

9
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:23,629
in the face.

10
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:24,469
What's his name?

11
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:26,150
Terrell Johnson, man.

12
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:26,530
Okay.

13
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,069
So, my kid gets shot

14
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:28,789
in the face.

15
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:33,129
The guy that shot him,

16
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:36,389
his mother, gets injured or

17
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:36,729
whatever,

18
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:39,870
and the kid said to

19
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,930
my kid's mother,

20
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:44,849
well, it might be your

21
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:46,310
dad that killed my mom.

22
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,210
I'm not killing nobody, man.

23
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,680
My son got shot, man.

24
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,710
That's it, man.

25
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,930
My son got shot.

26
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:56,610
That's it.

27
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:58,430
I just ride past.

28
00:02:58,889 --> 00:02:59,289
That's it.

29
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:00,810
They know that.

30
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:03,270
Man, they know how I

31
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,629
look and everything, man.

32
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:06,409
They know how I look.

33
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,370
They asked that lady,

34
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,729
hey, how do your baby

35
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:09,370
daddy look?

36
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,229
They know how I look.

37
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:14,050
Tell me about when you

38
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:14,810
said you ride past.

39
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:15,729
What does that mean?

40
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,400
Since my sons got shot,

41
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,259
I ride past, and I

42
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:22,800
go see.

43
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,300
I asked that they told

44
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,020
me and my kid's mother.

45
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,520
They didn't want to tell

46
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,560
us a story about what

47
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,360
happened to my kid.

48
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,740
We don't feel like talking

49
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,319
right now.

50
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:36,240
And I say, okay, well,

51
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,939
I'll come to you, and

52
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,379
I'll ride past every day.

53
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,219
I mean, we cool.

54
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,960
I'm like, you guys, it's

55
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,620
dad as well.

56
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:44,319
Why wouldn't you want to

57
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:44,860
talk to me?

58
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,240
That's it.

59
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,159
You guys have known each

60
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:47,780
other a long time.

61
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:48,280
Yeah.

62
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,580
They played on my son's

63
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,960
basketball team for seven years,

64
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,180
man.

65
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:51,479
Okay.

66
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,439
That's a chunk.

67
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:54,060
Yeah.

68
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:14,949
It's kind of weird that

69
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:17,230
I'm here.

70
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,050
I read the signs and

71
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,790
stuff, and I'm like, this

72
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:24,310
is some stuff, man, pertaining

73
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,129
to kids, man.

74
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,170
That ain't my lifestyle.

75
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:28,290
You understand me?

76
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,870
You understand me?

77
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:30,959
You understand me?

78
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,540
This is not right to

79
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:31,759
me.

80
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,420
This isn't the first time

81
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,699
that this has happened over

82
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:36,879
here.

83
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,019
Right?

84
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,420
My son's been shot once

85
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,079
before in McDonough Projects from

86
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,120
her house.

87
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,199
Okay.

88
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,920
Right.

89
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,980
Their house gets shot up

90
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,339
in Mount Airy.

91
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,399
Oh, I'm telling my son

92
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,240
every time, why would you

93
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,019
hang with somebody that has

94
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:57,560
brothers?

95
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,480
You don't hang with three

96
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,240
brothers, son.

97
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:02,620
He's three friends and a

98
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,019
stranger.

99
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,759
He don't get it until

100
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,100
this happens to him.

101
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,860
He gets shot in the

102
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,180
face.

103
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,699
It hurt my heart to

104
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:11,959
death.

105
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,279
It hurt me and my

106
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:13,680
family.

107
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:17,350
But I'm not doing nothing

108
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,269
with no lady, my man.

109
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,529
I'm an adult.

110
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:21,889
If I'm going to do

111
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:22,730
something, it's going to be

112
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,870
the dude that did something

113
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,569
to my child.

114
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,089
I still feel that same

115
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:26,410
way.

116
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,910
I want him to die

117
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,550
before me.

118
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,629
I want that.

119
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,189
Yeah.

120
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:32,490
He hurt my child.

121
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,209
But I'm not going to

122
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:34,290
hurt him.

123
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:34,290
I'm not going to hurt

124
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,250
nobody, man.

125
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,209
So I don't need to

126
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:38,149
be at homicide.

127
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,860
Right.

128
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:58,329
You said you just drive

129
00:05:58,329 --> 00:05:58,850
by then.

130
00:05:59,050 --> 00:05:59,689
I drive.

131
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:00,269
Have you tried to make

132
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:01,389
contact with them there?

133
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,490
Yes, we have.

134
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,389
Okay.

135
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:05,209
We got text messages and

136
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:05,930
everything, man.

137
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,589
Tell me about that.

138
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:08,410
We text them and ask

139
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,370
them the story.

140
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:10,149
Who is them?

141
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,379
Mari.

142
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,560
Mari is the oldest son.

143
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,040
Okay.

144
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,720
She has like three boys.

145
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,279
And they're all the same

146
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,439
age group as my son.

147
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:20,589
Okay.

148
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,470
If you go on Facebook,

149
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:22,629
this is what they said.

150
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,029
They said.

151
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:24,189
So we didn't know a

152
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:24,490
story.

153
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:24,970
Okay.

154
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:28,860
My son is, he was

155
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,759
so messed up that he

156
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,779
couldn't talk for a while.

157
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:32,500
So he couldn't say a

158
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,579
story or he couldn't do

159
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:33,899
anything.

160
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,310
And I'm not with his

161
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:37,629
mother.

162
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,949
And when I go down

163
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:41,029
there, they didn't let me

164
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:42,110
in because.

165
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:42,990
Down in the hospital?

166
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,589
Yeah.

167
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:43,930
Okay.

168
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,240
Her other, her boyfriend is

169
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,379
there, but her husband, you

170
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:49,540
know, because they've been together

171
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,319
for about six years.

172
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,139
But they didn't let me

173
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:52,319
in.

174
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,540
Whatever.

175
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,620
I sat down there, me

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,699
and the guy get into

177
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:57,300
an altercation.

178
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:00,980
The husband?

179
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:01,819
Yeah.

180
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:02,139
Okay.

181
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:04,790
And I go on Facebook.

182
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,170
I'm angry.

183
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:07,689
I'm upset.

184
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:10,449
I say her name on

185
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:11,990
the thing and everything.

186
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:13,050
I say his name as

187
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:13,269
well.

188
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:16,029
The next day, she contacts

189
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:18,329
my mother and me and

190
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:20,329
her are talking without him.

191
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:22,810
And she's telling me how

192
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,649
she talked to him and

193
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:24,850
stuff.

194
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:25,730
And then I'm telling her.

195
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,470
Well, I ride past there

196
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,310
all the time and I

197
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,410
see the little dudes standing

198
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,709
out there and you know,

199
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:32,170
I mean, I, I, you

200
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,089
know, I asked them and

201
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:33,829
they told me the same

202
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,149
thing, right?

203
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,230
I'm like, they're going to

204
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:37,490
talk.

205
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:39,389
He's going to actually just

206
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:41,329
wait till JJ come around.

207
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,930
When JJ came around, um,

208
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:47,899
the little guys, they keep

209
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:48,939
texting them and stuff.

210
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,360
Right.

211
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,600
And like, um, trying to

212
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,420
give him a story because

213
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,600
Jarrell was supposed to be.

214
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,329
Unconscious or something to where

215
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:01,910
he didn't know what happened.

216
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:03,410
So they're trying to give

217
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:03,889
him a story.

218
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,509
Okay.

219
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:06,310
He says the lady come

220
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,490
in and she keeps saying,

221
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:08,610
is you going to tell

222
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,610
him my son or something

223
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,269
or, um, giving him the

224
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:12,629
story?

225
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,709
And she said, I'm going

226
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:15,430
to tell the police that

227
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,699
you came here.

228
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,300
Don't tell him that you

229
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,600
got shot here or something.

230
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,310
He was saying, right.

231
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,829
When you say the lady,

232
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:25,509
who are you talking about?

233
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:26,589
I don't know.

234
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,209
You said the lady is

235
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:28,649
telling him.

236
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,250
The lady, he said, it's

237
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:30,529
a lady.

238
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:31,470
It's a, it's a dog

239
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,789
at the house as well.

240
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,210
So she's telling him that,

241
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,690
um, don't tell the cops

242
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,490
that he got shot here.

243
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,730
There at that house.

244
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,710
Exactly.

245
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:45,370
That's it.

246
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,549
That's all we knew.

247
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,169
That's the only story he

248
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:48,350
said.

249
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,990
And I said, well, and

250
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,370
like I told her, I

251
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,039
said, um, my son doesn't

252
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,460
want to tell the police.

253
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:02,580
And she, I guess, wants

254
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:02,980
to protect him.

255
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,259
She wants to protect his

256
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:03,820
reputation.

257
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,120
That's not my plan, man.

258
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,159
Right?

259
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:08,720
I've been shot here two

260
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,019
times.

261
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,159
I'm an important guy.

262
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,360
You do something to me,

263
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,159
you going to jail.

264
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,200
Right?

265
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,440
If I, if I do

266
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,419
something, I'm going to own

267
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:17,019
up to it, man.

268
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:19,120
I ain't did nothing right.

269
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,149
And it ain't right.

270
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,309
It's not right.

271
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,549
How Minnesota doing, man?

272
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,870
Because it is on Facebook

273
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,149
every day, man.

274
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:33,450
These little gooses making posts.

275
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:37,700
They make, my son, they

276
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,360
it up, man.

277
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,019
Forget about the injury.

278
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,919
They it up, too, man.

279
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,419
It's, oh, it ain't right,

280
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:46,720
man.
